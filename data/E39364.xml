“Generally good employer that gradually weakens and does not seem to return to good ol' days”

</title><pros>Pros – good culture and communication among employees, but senior management does no communicate openly and often decisions are top-down from HQ in the netherlands. These decisions are often not in best interest of national and regional perspective.Good benefits in general, but huge cost pressure had negative impact on overall climate</pros>
<cons>Cons – No clear promotion scheme nor any development paths for talented people. More of a "yes, yes" attitude and open communication is not enforced.Culture seems to be more and more based on political tactics than meritocracy.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – If possible be stronger with own decisions and not just act as puppet of group's HQ. Enforce stronger communication from senior management to employees and give clear, open feedback.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
