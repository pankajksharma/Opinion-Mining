“Great workplace”

</title><pros>Pros – This is a great place to work.Substantial PTO and even more time earned after year 1. Management allows for a flexible work schedule, for instance, if you have a Dr. appointment you are able to come in later/leave early, just make up the time missed.Provides healthcare, dental, vision, 401K.Management is very responsive  - one quick email to them and you get a reply very quickly. This is appreciated and shows that employees are valued.Owner provides employees with comp beverages (pop, water, Monster, Red Bull) during the workday.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Nothing that I can think of at the present time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep up the great work. It is nice to work for an organization where you feel important.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>

“Small company, Newly Created Position, Fired after 90 days”

</title><pros>Pros – Small company with great potential; you will play an important role in your position.  Down to earth CEO who you will see on a daily basis, jokes are the norm around the office.  Free Red Bull, Pop, Gatorade, Beer, Monster Energy etc...)</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very little training will be provided before being expected to work.  Not very tolerant of mistakes and they will expect you to work during off hours; compensation for your work will not be equal to your level of stress and workload.  You will be given tasks to complete with very little instruction on how to complete them.    In addition to that, you will be required to do more than just project management; you will be doing HR functions (time sheets, write-up meetings, office errands, and anything else they can think of.)  Newly created position and I could tell they didn't do much planning for the position.   High turnover, they will fire you quickly.  I was fired after only 3 months, didn't really have a chance to learn the position, I was figuring things out as I went along.  They fired another guy in a different position after only being there for a little over a month for a minor reason.</cons>
