“Great environment, provided you get along with management”

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible hours, mos employees are very nice to work with, and some opportunity for overtime even with salaried positions.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very disorganized, everyone wears too many hats IMO, not a very positive or productive environment, not a true "professional" atmosphere...which has definite positives but unfortunately as an adult you learn that rules are good to have and keep things in order...biggest issue is that management has no clue as to how the organization is even running on a day to day basis. They literally have to ask people what they "do" and rarely even aware of what their answers are.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Truly look at why your company lacks the ability to succeed, and continues to stay at the mediocre level it is at. It i sad when management loses touch with those "lower" on the totem pole. You may be extremely busy (that is apparent), but with our EVERYONE supporting you...where are you. Make sure the one's that are your "support" are truly who you think they are...where there is a common denominator in all "issues" in your day to day business, don't ignore it. You WILL lose good people.</advice-to-management>
