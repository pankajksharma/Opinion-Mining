“Beautiful Setting out in redwood country”

</title><pros>Pros – Very good at training employees.  Loved the 10:30 am break where donuts and fruit were provided and you could relax and socialize.  Production managers would also break at this time and would share the table with you.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very strict.  Think of Prussian military.  Time is crucial.  Don't ever clock in a minute late, you will have a meeting with your supervisor.  I would recommend to a friend, but with the reservation that you have to be good at what you do, detail oriented and be prepared to be treated like a number.  They don't seem to appreciate their employees other than give them a paycheck.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Work to make a company priority that employees are courteous to each other.  Reducing that kind of friction would improve productivity, attitudes and the bottom line and would not cost much.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
