“AVOID”

</title><pros>Pros – You will do a variety of tasks, but without any appreciation.  The staff are generally very nice people.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is a joke. There are no benefits.  Your work will be criticized and picked apart no matter what.  The owners use the security cameras to watch employees.  You feel like you have to walk on eggshells every day and you will have every little mistake thrown in your face.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
