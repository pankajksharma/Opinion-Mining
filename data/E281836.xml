“Spiritual place to work with some drawbacks”

</title><pros>Pros – Family feel amongst staff and faculty (especially within teaching departments), clear spiritual priorities for a Catholic school, great opportunities to get involved with kids and extra curriculars, students overall enjoyable to teach and be around each day, nice long breaks for major Holidays, support provided by administration for disciplinary issues, Principal Vorbach is terrific</pros>
<cons>Cons – New President making a lot of unwanted changes and communication on some of these decisions ambiguous at best. Pay is not as high as public schools (to be expected). Focus often seems on advanced classes (honors and advanced placement). Evaluation of teachers needs work and incompetent teachers need to be identified.</cons>
