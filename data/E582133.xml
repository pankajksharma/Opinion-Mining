“horrible workplace for a high school junior”

</title><pros>Pros – Free meal from a select menu; decent pay I suppose. You meet lots of new people because its downtown and very tourist oriented.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I was in high school and they kept getting upset because my parents wouldnt allow me to stay past 11 pm. Im not sure exactly what the time constraints are for a 17 year old, but they would keep girls as young as 16 til 4 am because it is a 24 hour restaurant. not good when school starts at 7:45!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – If youre going to hire kids in high school, show that you care about their education. Dont demand that they stay til 4 am and certainly dont play favorites. One of you would take certain girls and sit and talk to them through hour plus lunches. What kind of management is that?</advice-to-management>
