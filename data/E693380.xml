<title>

“Part-time job for 12 + years”

</title><pros>Pros – Unlike some workout facilities the Y is more of a laid back family oriented place to work out as well as hang with your kids or take a class (fitness as well as non-fitness related).I've been able to have a balanced family and part-time work life.In addition to my hourly rate I get a discounted membership paying the difference between a single adult and family membership which amounts to a couple dollars out of each paycheck.  The current policy is employees must work a minimum of 20 hours quarterly (every 3 months) to be able to receive the membership discount.Working as many or few hours as my family and other part time job allows has never been a problem.  Folks are usually willing to trade or take shifts.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is a 20-word minimum here and I can't think of any so I'm just going to say there has never been a reason for me to leave my part time position.</cons>
