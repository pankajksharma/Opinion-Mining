<cons>Cons – Lacks formal typical firm structure. Job duties vary depending on others.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Adding some structure to the firm will only help this company grow. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed, however, adding organization and comprehensive training will only help in the long run. A good stepping stone for someone who wants to learn about this field and gain connections.</advice-to-management>
