“Bad Company”

</title><pros>Pros – Can make okay money in the summer.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Terrible management, very strict rules, poor pay, 1st shift has too many employees and can't make good money unless you get lucky with the trucks you get. The work is not worth the pay.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Price the trucks at a higher price and if employees do not make more than minimum wage in trucks then they should receive $10.00 and not minimum wage. Also when employees are waiting in the shack for a truck, let them use there cell phones so that there is something to occupy us instead of falling asleep and waiting for hours at a time with just cards to play with and eat food.</advice-to-management>
