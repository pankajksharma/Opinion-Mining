“Caring Business Positioned For Growth: employees, customers, and community come first”

</title><pros>Pros – Empowered and encouraged to be our best and take initiative. Sales compensation is unlimited, so it pays to work hard. Work-life balance is encouraged by senior management who puts their family first and is understanding when everyone else does the same. We serve educators which is a noble cause, and attracts a certain type of employee that cares about the community. Even though overall industry outlook is poor, a small company can continue to grow by taking market share.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Less resourced than specialty competitors across each category. Overall industry outlook is poor and does not appear to be improving. Profitable products from 2010 are already obsolete in the digital era and the reliance on manufacturers to invest in product development, make a 'hit', while also maintaining distribution rights.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Continually redefine mission and goals to execute with focus. Improve brand awareness.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
