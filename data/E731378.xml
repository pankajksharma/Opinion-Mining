<cons>Cons – As a boutique retained search firm and one of the best in the industry, we are often invited to compete against large and well-known global firms. Widespread name recognition for a boutique firm can be challenging from a new business development perspective; however, our 100% referenceable and renowned customer base, previous successes, refined methodologies, team approach, unique fee structure and proven ability to deliver significant return on clients' search investments generally unseats any hesitancy due to lack of familiarity. RGBA's track record is second to none.</cons>
