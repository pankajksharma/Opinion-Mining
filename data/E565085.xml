“Ideal for long-term work relationship”

</title><pros>Pros – As a 100% family-owned company, it also has a family-like work environment. Not as anonymous as multinational companies are. On a long-term basis, you feel that you actually achieve something and that you influence the course of the company. You can see the results of your work over time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Changes are difficult to make. Due to low employee fluctuation, carreer-building takes longer. Conservative environment, not fit for fast-carreer seekers. If you are not patient, you are not fit for the company culture. Top management is not making place for successors, but holds on to the job way beyond retirement age.</cons>
