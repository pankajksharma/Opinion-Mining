“Excellent Company - in the past. Now, not so much...”

</title><pros>Pros – Large company with great benefits; they also go by the rules of The Netherlands - which is their HQ. SO, no drug tests for example.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The current group of folks that pass for recruiters are bumbling & incompetent. There is a lot of nepotism and friends getting hired. When a job opening occurs, they interview 10 people - to satisfy some requirement - and then hire their friend or cousin instead. I end up working with these (unqualified) employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hire back some of the well experienced folks that were let go over all of the reorganizations of the last 5 years. I have referred excellent (laid off) employees - only to be rebuffed. I do not want the referral bonus, I want the positions filled by those that did them so well over the years.</advice-to-management>

“Technical Support Representative”

</title><pros>Pros – I have nothing but great things to say about working here.  I started my Technical Support career here and learned a great deal of valuable skills.  The customer service call center that I worked in had the best team.  Although most of the employees I worked with are not there, the Team Leader who shall remain anonymous, was super nice, but firm enough to get your butt into shape.</pros>
<cons>Cons – None that I can think of.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>

“Struggling to change, but with legacy management tools”

</title><pros>Pros – Wolters Kluwer has a large pool of talented people. The culture is collaborative within groups. The defined corporate strategy is sensible: moving up the value chain with clients, by embedding content within clients workflow processes.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Budget constraints & concerns flavor all human resource planning. Human resource support is basic, but getting better. Difficult to get approvals for creation of new positions, either to provide room for promotions, or to hire necessary additional support positions.The company is also hampered by silos of technology and of processes - with poor tools and little cultural support for breaking down silos and barriers to collaboration across groups.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Wolters Kluwer needs to examine its existing groups & decide where levels of investment need to be made not just based upon a profitability/growth spectrum, but also based upon potential profitability/growth. The lack of investment in talent, technology and organizational change in existing groups that don't meet p/g targets leads to a cycle where change can't be effectively implemented.</advice-to-management>

“Not what it use to be...”

</title><pros>Pros – Decent Salary. Good Benefits. Many very knowledgeable employees with a ton of experience.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No room for advancement or even lateral movement. Constant lay-offs. Very cliquish ... if you aren't part of a particular group, your days are numbered. Entire departments are being elimnated, yet the manager remains (who are they managing?). No H.R. support -- will back the Managers no matter what. Apathetic employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to employees complaints and take them seriously. Abandon the "if you don't like it then leave" attitude.  Instead of bring in new excutives/managers from the outside, try hiring from within.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – It's a pleasure to work for a company that has  a great product with a great mission and even better if the pay and benefits are also good.</pros>

“A lot of work, but worth the effort”

</title><pros>Pros – CCH has some of the best employees in the business.  Smart, talented and dedicated employees.  Decent pay and great benefits.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Upper management doesn't really seem to understand the market any more.  Too many shifting priorities as executives have changed several times over the last couple of years.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't be shy to spend money to bring the products where they need to be.   We are falling behind the competition, and it shows - both in the maturity of the suite and in the amount of customer churn. Listen to your product managers as they understand the market better than anyone.  Build products that delight its users. Customers pays a premium for CCH products - please reinvest that money in the products.</advice-to-management>

“Good pay and benefits; massive bureaucracy, no room to advance in my division"”

</title><pros>Pros – Good pay, excellent benefits, generous PTO policy.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I worked for a US company that was absorbed by WK, and it had the classic American company issues--petty middle management, no real advancement opportunities, and lousy office politics.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hard to advise upper management when there was none present. I think WK in general is probably a good company. The division of my subsidiary was just not right for me for the long haul. I'd work for WK again.</advice-to-management>

“Valuable and Engaging”

</title><pros>Pros – Worked with a wonderful team that was full of amazing individuals who have had experience in management consulting. Felt like the work I did was valuable to the company's business strategy. Participated and given opportunity to present the work and analysis I did, even as an intern. Insight into type of work that consultants get to do.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Did not have structured return offer system for summer interns.</cons>

“Current CCH Environment”

</title><pros>Pros – Pleasant coworkers: makes the work day brighter and helpful people make the job easier</pros>
<cons>Cons – Current database in use is far from user friendly for our type of work. People struggle to keep up with the workload. Working on one's own time is not uncommon nor noticed. Not all jobs are ideal, but they shouldn't case tears and headaches. Invest in Advil, Miller, and Edy's as their sales have definitely increased.</cons>

“Work, Work, Work--No work-life balance at all”

</title><pros>Pros – Excellent training program, supportive staff, educationally driven.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As an account manager in outside sales, you are hired to sell but inundated with massive amounts of minutia and email. Some emails can be answered or addressed quickly others however take you hours to complete. Multiply that by dozens of emails a day, and it's no wonder you can easily work 12-15 hour days just managing the paperwork. It's exhausting and endless. The down-side is management thinks there is nothing wrong with bombarding the account managers with daily doses of admin, reports for reports and more reports to report on those reports! It's like being in a hamster tread-mill of paperwork. Management however still demands that you make your quota and get into the field to see clients regardless of the hours spent behind your PC.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Help us make more sales by removing the mundane paperwork, non-stop reporting of account activity which is really something a sales admin department should be doing and please, please consolidate and update your PC systems so we can all be more efficient at our jobs.</advice-to-management>

“Dead cats don't bounce”

</title><pros>Pros – This once great company has a rich legacy of products, a strong brand, and a few really talented people who have a deep understanding of tax and accounting professional needs.Much needed changes has been introduced along with a new executive team.  The change is good  - the team and processes they bring - less so.</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Executive team micromanages the portfolio and costs.-Great at making plans - but then cutting expenses needed to support those plans and yet hold revenue targets.  Then have senior executives look at you as if your surprising them when you can't make the revenue targets you attempt to pull back on.-Leaders who think they understand the customer because they understand the process of gaining customer insights.  Gone for the most part are people who have actually worked in accounting and tax firms and/or studies tax and accounting from management.   So even the most basic observations about markets need to be explained over and over to key executives.-Almost all knowledgeable product managers are gone - so the people who understood why products were built and how they fit in with the portfolio workflow are not there to help the new executives understand the nuances.-recent disasters at CCH Small Firm Services around recent tax prep product launch (due to overly aggressive product introduction goals) have irreparably damaged CCH reputation in this segment of the market.  Choice of executives without experience or relationship with the target market will result in hampering any hope of recovering share in the near future.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Excessive controls and micromanaging is turning the limited talent into power point assemblers, rubber stampers, and totally unempowered. Risk taking and innovation by those who truly know the customer is down considerable.   New management team constantly marginalizes any different perspectives by forcing all decisions thru an internal spanking machine where it's easy to criticize but hard to champion anything new.   Stop designing systems and processes that thwart entrepreneurial spirit or the business will wither and die all too soon...</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Increase loyalty to tenured employees. Pay more attention to the upkeep of core material before pressing for new products. Without current core material, new products may be flashy, but they are reliable due to outdated information. Be more direct with employee communications, it's hard to understand the overall message through a bunch of numbers and slide presentations.

<cons>Cons – Once there were changes implemented and new management came on board, particular in the Finance department, the company became a "mans world" to work in. Management was sexist and didn't believe that women could accomplish their job. The environment was very hostile and management perceived women as not belonging in the work place and not having the same intelligence as men.</cons>

“A slowly sinking ship”

</title><pros>Pros – Because of the industry there is a good job security as long as you are capable of doing your job.There are some truly good people here.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Middle management of late has very little concept of employee satisfaction or modern business principles when it comes to management.  It often times feels like this company is stuck in the '80s.Lower rung employees are seen as a liability to the company rather than an asset, which leads to anti-employee sentiment from management from many of the management team.Salary and benefits are maintained at a "just barely enough" level to keep employees from jumping ship.Raises are scarce and infrequent, in the name of profitability.Poor management decisions on how to handle product development which lead to poor product performance are often times blamed on lower level employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Take a note from the companies who are at the top of the lists rather than whatever the latest corporate self-help book you picked up.  Realize that your employees at the lowest level are the some of the most important, particularly those who work directly with customers.CCH is one of the lowest rated companies in the country for employee satisfaction and it only continues to get worse.  It is hemorrhaging talent and getting an infusion of "lowest bidder" replacement warm bodies.  This is going to lead to the destruction of the excellent reputation the company has with it's customers which in turn is going to lead to dropping profits.This isn't the '80s, times have changed, and successful companies have realized that a happy workforce is a productive workforce.</advice-to-management>

“Beware of false promises”

</title><pros>Pros – Always some type of office party and PTO.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Beware! You have to pay for parking, and its based on seniority which means it could take up to 6 years to get a park spot. Management refuses to tackle hard hitting issues, such as the relationships between fulfillment and service teams. They also make many promises that they do not follow up on. During an interview they don't explain the road to management. Trying to get into a management position is almost impossible as it would take nearly 7-9 years. There is a lot of favoritism around the office among the staff, but even the favorites hate working here. Honestly, 95% of the office including some management clearly dislike their job environment. Its a job, but THATS IT. Most people in management positions were hired as managers. Its almost never that you hear someone has worked their way up in the company. Its sad when there are open management positions and employees aren't interested in them. Its even worse when most managers leave or drop down in position b/c the company is so unfair.</cons>

<cons>Cons – They make up numbers and say that the company is frowing 10% while the numbers are declining.C&G in particular is really bad with a extremely bad management teamThe turnover is huge these days. No employee lasts more than 1-2 years.The NY sales team expereinced a 100% turnover in less than a year....that just speaks volumes for itselfYou can get nothing done in this firm as management is in denial, deceptive and are not supportive of employees</cons>

“It's a train wreck”

</title><pros>Pros – Good benefits, on site full service cafeteria, fitness center, generous time off which you need because the work environment is so stressful</pros>
<cons>Cons – Department went through a re-org about a year ago.  People who had no sales background were dropped into sales positions that have no interest in selling - especially the sales of complex legal research solutions.  Since the re-org the department is  completely unorganized.  Halfway through the comp year management still cannot provide accurate sales and inventory numbers to the sales force due to horrendous problems that occurred with the installation of SAP.  Management blames low sales on the sales staff and gives micromanagement a whole new meaning.  Everyone in the department is stressed out and morale is in the tank.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop blaming the sales force for the bad decisions upper level management has made.  Let up on the pressure and get off our backs until you actually have your act together.  Once all the systems are functional then you have the right to come down on us.</advice-to-management>

“Great company, product, and culture but needs organizational help”

</title><pros>Pros – Wonderful product - the best in the market - this product replaces text books at medical schools;  Medical reference topics are written by top physician specialists in their field, akin to having a top consultant friend for every medical discipline/subject area.Clinicians and other users love UpToDate - our users sell our products - I've never seen so much fan mail.Competition has to resort to spin and misleading advertising to gain market share - their topics are written by medical writers, not physicians; and they contain substantial inaccurate recommendations.Committed employees who believe in improving patient care.Great bonuses.Employees are treated kindly and respectfully by management, far better than at most similar high tech companies.Deeply committed and astute female MD CEO who 'tells it like it is'.Part of Wolters Kluwer Health (WKH), umbrella parent company with breath and depth of offerings, so we have a promising future as part of larger suite of products.We listen to our customers and believe in the 'wisdom of the crowd' where user feedback constantly helps us curate our medical content; customers also help us refine features and UI design.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Base salary lower than most comparable high tech companies.Hierarchical and rigid management in some departments, akin to a 'medical center' environment, as many MDs are top managers.Company grew from a publishing to a software company, growing pains.Consensus senior management, so change is slow and painful.Lack of organizational infrastructure in many areas.Political difficulties with sister companies in WKH - lack of high level WKH direction leaves individual OUs to duke it out by themselves.Hiring the best medical specialists in the field and including top graphics means substantial royalty payments, so the product is expensive and eats into a healthcare organization's budget - overcoming this hurdle is difficult in today's economic environment where most healthcare organizations are asked to slash budgets.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – High-quality, dedicated staff. Decent time off policy--but you may be expected to be available weekends and during days off, depending on your job. Job satisfaction in relation to providing valuable information for health care professionals.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As with other publishers, this company is experiencing the stresses of transitioning from print to online. Understaffing, frequent changes in job descriptions, and the constant threat of layoffs can make for a stressful environment. Most creative and editorial work is outsourced.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Facilitate cross-department communication. The right hand often does not know what the left hand is doing.</advice-to-management>

“CCH has a great market reach and a great group of people”

</title><pros>Pros – The people of CCH make the company. It doesn't matter if it is the leadership or the contractors, the people you deal with are genuine, intelligent and take their jobs earnestly. The work is rewarding and you get the opportunity to put your hand into a lot of variety as far as projects go. The pay isn't great, but isn't bad for the market.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is a silo mentality that exists between product management and production that simply can't exist in a truly agile enterprise.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Better pay and a stronger business strategy would help increase market reach. You preach innovation and undermine it frequently.</advice-to-management>

“Company That Doesn't Know Where It Wants to Go”

</title><pros>Pros – There are a lot of benefits...20 PTO days, 12 Holidays, lots of good insurance options, and it's a really slooooooooow pace. It's great if you don't want to have to do a lot of work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There's basically no promotion from within. There's no promotion or hiring really. The publishing side of the business is dying a slow death. And the leadership is nonexistent. If you have an idea to make things better, you will be discouraged from doing anything about it by your manager. There's a lot of corporate speak and people who are good at sounding smart, but very few actual doers. And the upper management is only interested in investing in things that are going to reduce head count. When software is being developed, the first requirement given is that the software must reduce head count. It's a terrible place to work.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You need to completely turn around the culture. Get your VPs out on the floor working with people. Flatten out the organization. Middle managers are tabling process improvements that are very necessary because they're afraid that you're going to ask for them to cut headcount if you find out that a time saving possibility exists. It's a real disincentive to innovate. Also 90% of your staff has been in publishing way too long. Publishing isn't the same as it used to be. And you have no tech-friendly youth in the company.</advice-to-management>

“Has its pros and cons, like any other place”

</title><pros>Pros – - Good compensation and benefits, especially for recent hires.- Flexible work environment.- Good work/life balance.- Very nice office in downtown Minneapolis (not as nice in St. Cloud).- People are friendly (adjust for "Minnesota nice").</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Lack of product vision, especially in software products.- History and continued practice of making bad acquisitions, followed by poorly managed integration into the existing business.- Lots of people in senior leadership positions who got there through tenure, not through accomplishment or talent.  Most of these folks are more interested in preserving the status quo than in moving the company forward.- Very consensus-driven culture.  For some, that's a good thing, but the need for unanimous consensus results, in my opinion, in no progress or in compromises that don't make sense.- Depending on your own beliefs this may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it's a very conservative group of people, especially in the St. Cloud office.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Consider that you will not win a competition in the software product market unless you bring people in who understand software development and hosted IT operations.  Very few such people are on the inside today.  You need some experienced perspective from the outside and you need to clear the internal obstacles to the changes that need to be made in order to become a technology-savvy company.</advice-to-management>

“About as good as you can expect right now”

</title><pros>Pros – Long standing brand (100 years) and marketplace position.  Some really good people work here.  Friendly Chicago offices. This company is more respectful towards older workers, which, as a younger worker, I really respect.  It might be one of the last companies out there that appear to actually makes an attempt to retain aging mid-level workers who have been loyal after many years of service.  I'm giving it 3 stars on a because I know how it stacks up against other opportunities in the marketplace. I believe there are only a handful of 4 star companies out there, and so this is pretty much as good as it gets right now (which I don't think is good at all).  There are some forward thinking strategies, some are misguided though. My impression is the CEO of Wolters Kluwer (not CCH, the sub - she is new so I have no opinion yet) is a forward thinker and she takes a balanced and rational approach to company strategy.  She does not come across as the tyrannical type that head up so many other companies right now.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Just like every other massive company out there there are never ending unrealistic expectations of perpetual growth.  Mysterious faceless executives make sweeping changes and crony based promotions abound as they do in every other company in America. This company is based out of the Netherlands, and the US branch is held much higher profit and efficiency standards.  The US has much lower benefits than their European counterparts.  The whole idea that I should in-debt myself to the banks for 30 years, give half my earnings to the gov't, take a brief 1 week vacation, and then enslave myself to a corporation just so I can live hand to mouth until the day I die really does not appeal to me.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You need more flexible pricing strategies to secure revenue streams over longer periods.  The marketplace is volatile and we are losing customers we could otherwise retain.  You need to allow for more creative solutions.  Sales people are extremely important to the lifeblood of your business, and and the current model does not empower us enough.  Encourage process worker b's to think outside the box and solve problems creatively without just going back to the rule book or having to talk to management.  We have some people who are really stuck in rigid processes and it slows sales down to a crawl sometimes.  Overall I think CCH is one of the better companies out there, but there is not nearly enough transparency in management.  As every corporation does, you still have serious problems with nepotism. Man-up/Woman-up management-and squash this! You'll earn a lot of respect for it. Tell your buddies to go get another job at another company  (you can give them a stellar recommendation still) and make new friends at the water cooler-they will make out ok. Every worker in America is tired of the same old routine and we will reach a breaking point, I promise.   A good start to changing things would be to start enforcing mandatory vacation (don't forget to include sales) as your European counterparts do.  That would be a nice change and forward thinking.  Nothing worse than having vacation and not being able to actually use it - it is a bait and switch routine and we are all tired of this.</advice-to-management>

“Risk and reward in the ROC division”

</title><pros>Pros – Certain of the upper middle managers are outstanding. By and large it is a "moral compass" type of environment; do the right thing and you'll be ok. There is very little political backstabbing. Most of the people in the Financial Services division called Risk, Origination and Compliance are decent people who want to get along and do the right thing. There is a fair amount of intellectual capital here with dozens of people who know a lot about banking.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The top manager in the division comes from a manufacturing background and is a mechanistic thinker. Totally process and numbers driven, seems not to really grasp what is required to succeed as an intellectual property provider. There is literally NO strategy driving the ROC division at this point. Focus at the top is painfully short sighted, driven purely by quarterly and monthly numbers. The sales revenue is tracked DAILY even though the sales cycle averages 18 months. The short sighted approach has led to the loss of a LOT of good talented people. Some have been cut to make numbers, many leave because they can go somewhere that encourages real innovation. The "motivational" video at the annual meeting for ROC says it all.....a football coach screaming at a high school football player for having a quitter's attitude. Message: suck it up and do as you're told.The bottom line here is that the ROC division has about two years to make some senior management changes and get back on track, or very likely it will go into a death spiral. But there are still enough positives that it could be a great company, just won't happen with the current leadership. Know that coming in and plan accordingly.......</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You need to change the focus from this months numbers to actually growing a healthy company. Your customers are starting to notice the lack of investment and your employees definitely notice your complete focus on the short term, which is sucking the drive and energy out of them and creating a fear culture. Take down all the posters that talk about how much you value your employees and customers, and start showing them.......actions speak louder than words.</advice-to-management>

“You will row in place without promotion or training until you die”

</title><pros>Pros – Good established name brand.  Product content is usually high quality.  Lots of mid-level talent here that goes untapped.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The position you are hired in for is probably the one you will die in.  This is a multinational organization that is ruled with a Dutch finance mentality.  It has constant  and absurdly detailed heavy financial reporting requirements, and reporting of all types in general is generally out of control.  It's not run as a homogenous organization, but as a loose confederation of companies that pretty much do whatever they want.  People are paid a fair wage, but that's it.  The company will not spend one penny on your training or professional development - (this is probably the only multinational corporation in the world that doesn't even have a Training Department.).  Career-pathing is non-existent.  Jobs on the upper third of the ladder are always filled by well-meaning but clueless outsiders, and never from the experienced staff from within.  50% of the managers don't even bother doing reviews, and most employees don't even care, since the review process isn't the foundation for anything that affects your pay or promotion.  Every November-December there is a grim reaper cutback exercise that chops some heads, and you will probably survive this process for several years initially, but eventually they will come for you as well.  If you are young, you will figure out quickly that no one retires out of this place, as you will not be allowed to stay that long without being chopped at some point..</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Promote ONLY from within, and stop hiring outside heroes who come from your favorite consulting firm cronies or vendors that you are buddy-buddy with.  Invest in your people and take positive steps to offer training and career path progression. You want to grow the business?  Do a better job at growing your people first.</advice-to-management>

“If you enjoy not having a life, then the Researcher role is for you...”

</title><pros>Pros – Salary is ok and I concur with the previous poster that opportunity to earn extra income through overtime and working on weekends can make it worthwhile, but all of this comes at a price.  TIMEWorking overtime is a way of life not an occasional necessity.  Weekends is optional and lots of people work so much OT that they usually say the heck with working on the weekends even though it can be lucrative.You will learn a lot, especially lots of esoteric information.Good benefits, health insurance etc...Comfortable work environment and the ability to telecommute.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Extremely poor work life balance.  If you are looking for a 9-5 job, this isn't for you.  Because there is a never ending need for employees to work overtime, needless to say you aren't leaving at 5:00 or even 6:00, you get the picture.  Depending on the length of your commute, arriving home at 8 or 9:00 or even later on a fairly regular basis is a way of life.  If you have commitments in the evening (family, children, school) they'd better be understanding of your crazy schedule.  Upper management realizes all of this is a big problem and the strain it puts on their employees, however there is little they can do about it, as employees leave or are let go, replenishing the head count is difficult.  A long training process is involved and typically takes 6 months to a year for a new hire Researcher to get up to speed.  Also, one of every four people hired do not pan out others become dissatisfied with the position and the demands it makes on one's life and decide to hang it up.  So there is lots of one step forward two steps back kind if thing going on.  To their credit management has taken steps to make the training shorter and make it a more pleasant place to work, alleviating  some of the strain on the current group, but all of this is moving at a glacial pace.Negativity galore.  The previous poster is correct, you'll be told every way conceivable on how you screwed up, while part of this is necessary, there is little or no positive enforcement.  And the draconian and at times subjective point scoring system doesn't help.  If you want to feel like you are back in Jr. high, then you won't mind this.</cons>

“good career at this company”

</title><pros>Pros – Products number one in the marketplace.  Esteemed in professional circles.  Dominant lines.  Competition is far behind</pros>
<cons>Cons – More and more managers are hired from outside without a clue about the products, markets, the culture.  They also lack basic management skills.  Hard for good ideas to get an airing.  The long term market domination is in danger of fading without concern from management whose main goal is to just "move forward".</cons>

“Big Publishing continues to have ndustry challenges”

</title><pros>Pros – Great people, strong and recognized band in the B2B Publishing industry, recognized as an industry leader in both publishing and software, and part of Wolters Kluwer, a Global enterprise.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Difficult transition from traditional publishing environment to online/mobile. Print revenue is in decline. Customers are finding other resources to do their research online which are not as expensive or free.  Delivery of flagship Tax SaaS software suite has experienced multi-year delays which lead to revenue challenges in recent quarters.  Where is the young innovative talent?</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Determine whether the company specializes in publishing/professional research or is a software company and focus in one direction.  Mediocre performance in one area seems to drag on the overall profitability of this company.

“Work/life balance here is all work and no life”

</title><pros>Pros – Paid overtime.Weekend work. If you haven't already had enough of doing research during the week.Lunch provided sometimes. Allegedly its to thank researchers for all their hard work...but we all known its just so we don't have to leave the office and so we can just keep working through lunch.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Excessive amounts of overtime (50+ hours/week), you also have to ask permission to leave at a reasonable hour I.e. 5/530 even if you will have already worked more than 8 hours at that point. As previous posters noted, you will have no life. Don't even try to make plans during the week because you will either be late or not make them.Tedious work. If you enjoy constantly repetitive work for countless hours, this is the job for you.No recognition for good work, constant penalization for minor mistakesNo advancement opportunitiesLittle/no human interaction (all work is on a computer)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management is apparently ok with the fact that turnover is remarkably high because they have done very little to make people want to stay. What measures they have taken have had very little effect. In fact, some measures have had the opposite effect of their stated purpose. Perhaps management should care more about their employees instead of grinding them down until they just can't take anymore and quit...but that probably won't happen anytime soon.</advice-to-management>

“Understaffed, overworked, unappreciated - CT has it all!”

</title><pros>Pros – You can't beat the PTO - 4 weeks to start + 3-4 optional days a year; increases to 5 and 6 weeks after 5 and 10 years, respectively.  35 hour work week, good benefits package (health is great, dental is lacking), casual dress, and great co-workers, for the most part.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Everything else.  The job itself is grossly misrepresented during the interview process.  The 35 hour work week is wonderful in theory, but employees typically exceed 40 thanks to offices being understaffed.  There are plenty of employees who have been around for 10+ years, but turnover is high amongst new, college educated employees who have little incentive to stick around once they realize what they've stepped into, and that the "multitude" of advancement opportunities they were promised when applying for the job simply aren't available to them; you should expect to remain in your entry level position for five years (minimum), regardless of job performance.  Once you've passed the five year mark, ensure that you aren't TOO good at your job, as you might be deemed too valuable to a department and blocked from advancing elsewhere.  Management, from the top down, is inept and has no interest in hearing any ideas that fall outside of their own narrow view.  The company's idea of "employee development" is forcing them to take at least 4 online courses - glorified power point presentations - a year, most of which on subjects that relate little, if at all, to your actual employment goals.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Reward your employees where it counts: their pockets.  Miniscule raises and consistently decreasing bonuses when the company is clearly profiting are little incentive to keep educated employees from looking elsewhere.</advice-to-management>

“Poor managers, zero tolerance for constructive & confidential feedback about managers”

</title><pros>Pros – Good PTO, somewhat flexible schedule but all depends what group you work for and your managers style</pros>
<cons>Cons – Poor management skills.  Many managers promoted into managerial roles are friends with little to no management skills which contribute to poor morale, mentoring, leadership abilities.  Very cut-throat culture where if you want to climb the ladder you will throw anyone under the bus.  Management will NOT listen to employee feedback about managers.  NO DRAMA is their motto.  If you voice any concern you are on the black ball list and will never go anywhere in the company.  HR sides with management at ALL times, no exceptions.  Little to no trust for management team.  Very low morale and toxic work environment.  Work-life balance is their motto and stressed during the interview process, but once your feet get wet you are working 24/7 and depending on your position and your manager, your work life may be all you know.  No time for family.  If you are on PTO you are expected to maintain and answer emails and managers call frequently.  Close knit friends involved on sr. Management team and if they don't like you and your not in the "in" crowd - expect to go no where.  Very little respect between managers and employees.  Your spoken to in a condense ding, belittling manor.</cons>

“Incompetent leadership with inflexible middle management”

</title><pros>Pros – - OK place to start learning- Benefits are above average</pros>
<cons>Cons – Anyone worth their salt has already left or is planning on leaving. There are several reasons for this:- Unfair compensation: Some get wonderful salaries while others are left to feed on the scraps.- Cowboy coding culture: The only way anything gets done on time is if someone steps up and works 60+ hour work weeks to finish it. Even then, requirements are incomplete and make no sense. Usually when I asked a BA a question to clarify the business' intentions their answer was simply 'I don't know' with no attempt to figure it out.  This is a company that wants to be (even claims to be!) agile, but in reality uses the waterfall software development lifecycle.- Management has no clue: The attitude at WKFS is: If it's not working, lay off the entire middle management, then hire one CTO and have him hire his friends. The new CTO then proceeds to 'shake things up' resulting in the exact same mismanagement. This cycle happens every few years.- NIMBYism. 'But that's how we always did/do it!'. No one is willing to change and is overly protective of their jobs/area of work.- Products/features customers do not want or need. I worked on one product for which this company had sunk literally millions of dollars into and yet after several years, had no customers for. Instead of taking the loss and writing it off as a failure, they attempted to 'integrate' it into other products sinking even more money into stuff no client wanted or asked for.- Very slow moving. Change happens incredibly slowly for all the reasons previously state.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop trying to fix everything yourself and get some outside help. Current leadership is completely ineffective at fixing anything. Lay off the people who've been there for 40+ years and refuse to change. Adapt or die at the hands of Thompson Reuters.</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – This is for the assistant managing editors only (I've never had direct interaction with deputy-editor staff, and very little with the managing editors... although all issues presumably begin at the top): Get some training and refrain from treating the editorial assistants like "minions" (actually a direct quote from one AME). I think it's important to obtain regular training on how to manage employees (without resorting to micromanaging). It's understandable to get training-- we all aren't born with a natural management gene.</advice-to-management>

“Great for the young, just out of school aspiring sales rep”

</title><pros>Pros – Great product- best there is out there. Great people to work with. Sales management 'gets it.' Improved comp plan though still a challenge to hit goals. Customers love the product. Improvements internally resulted in improved customer interaction and a focus on customer satisfaction.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Salary is not competitive within the market. Salary is not even competitive within the WK Health brand.  Expected to sustain sales despite poor marketing, saturated market and customers who are not in compliance with their agreements. Recovering from poor reputation from years past.  Finance department is slow, controlling and should stick to finance. Division between several sales departments makes it hard to sell. Should focus on client compliance.  No commission plan. Bonuses paid out after several months. Improved comp plan is best at over achievement which is nearly impossible. Management has little power. Subscription model and recognization of revenue a challenge.Side note- while Bud Rose is not the CEO, he is the founder. He is a wonderful man. Nobody would rate him poorly.  The CEO is Denise Basow. I have had no interaction with her so I can't really comment here. She becamse CEO once UpToDate was bought by Wolters Kluwer Health. She has made improvements. I would certainly question her support of the finance department's power over matters that they do not and can not comprehend.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Do not let the finance department make decisions. They do not understand the "sale."  Promote your good reps and allow them to advance. Understand the challenges of a saturated market. Perhaps reconsider a hybrid role (Rumors are that this was once the norm).    Research the opportunities of each market and allow your reps larger territories.</advice-to-management>

“Not very satisfied”

</title><pros>Pros – European vacation package, decent food court</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low pay, so far away, not challenging, very repetitive</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more forthright with your employees. Being one of the younger hires, I was let go when the economy soured, but they had the audacity to keep me on staff phasing out my job to someone in Arkansas publication by publication. They gave a decent severance package, which was nice, but they could have been more honest with us. Don't tell us that everything is looking up in company wide meetings and then slash jobs when nobody is looking. The general mood of that company was always apprehensive. I don't know why you would hire the younger people who actually did work there either. The ones with the college education. For some reason senior management was always afraid of the senior employees. I never quite got-it. Grad school worked out much more than this career path did.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – Dutch company does not change schedule for US Holidays.  Accounting has to work 4th of July and Labor Day.  Accounting in the Health Division is very disorganized.  A lot of processes were outsourced to CapGemini (India) and that was not managed well.  After six months there are still a lot of mistakes coming from CapGemini.  Management is not very forgiving and expect more with less.  Very stressful place to work for Accounting, raises aren't based on work, no incentive to work harder.</cons>

“Facts hurt and doing the same thing over and over again by definition is INSANITY.”

</title><pros>Pros – None.  Well, they believe they are doing a good job in addressing growth and account retention but that is a complete false perception.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No growth potential.  No upper management vision, skill, or ability to keep customers happy.  No true ERM solution due to lackluster partnership management.  Unable to communicate any real quantitative value to its customers on ERM solution.....because the solution is completely vapor-ware.  Ask what their employee turnover is and their existing ERM customer base.  Those details alone identify the WKFS value.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get rid of any management who believe that if you aren't happy....then leave.

“MASS CONFUSION”

</title><pros>Pros – Top-notch, experienced personnel and good software products. WFKS division is fairly small but it derives big-company stature as part of the global WK corporate organization. Moderate pay but very good benefits package.</pros>
<cons>Cons – WKFS offers many products for the financial industry and this division is divided into three units-- banking, insurance, and securities-- but there is little communication between the three. Since many of their customers provide diversified financial services, a customer might have WKFS sales reps from multiple teams competing against one another to sell similar products into the same account. Their risk product suite includes an audit solution that is actually sold and supported by a totally separate business division. That product also competes directly with the Axentis solution, which is sold by another WK company under the same brand name. This is all very confusing to potential customers. WKFS derives most of its revenues from the sale of regulatory content so many of its managers come from legal and government backgrounds, and this results in an organization that is stagnant, slow-moving, and generally unresponsive to market changes.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – While you are busy holding conference calls and drafting memos, large competitors like Thomson Reuters (and several very aggressive small startups) are stealing your accounts at an alarming rate. Management needs to be more responsive to the dynamic nature of the compliance market, and to its customers' needs.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – You have to work from home and sell.  In 2008, they lost alot of brand recognition as the roll out of their platform was a bust.

</title><pros>Pros – Good budgeting for new equipment and software, responsive to unforeseen needs for hardware and software to keep things running smoothly.Very communicative of company goals and performance, as well as other HR information.Interested in Employee Feedback for cost reduction efforts in Benefits etc.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Poor communication between development and operations for software requirements.Bureaucracy can lead to a lot of red-tape in terms of getting things done.  (For instance we had a bi-weekly meeting to go over production outages for several areas of the company, it took 1-2 hours to get through even when there was little or nothing for anyone to report, and it devolved into a meeting about how we should be having the meeting, to the point where no one seemed to be interested in actually going over the information regarding the intended purpose for the meeting)Halved bonuses, froze raises, and halved 401K contributions due to economic down-turn and removed performance based bonuses until such time as they felt the economy was improved.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The praise we received that we were a portion of the company which was actually making them money was nice, but it still stings when no one will get any compensation  for it while other areas of the company are doing well.Take a care when it comes to outsourcing your email, it takes at least two days to get a new email or distribution group made, and it is never made right the first time.  This leads to a lot of lost productivity.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – A lot of management-by-default instead of decisiveness. Management has a tendency to involve itself too deeply in daily tasking (tactical) rather than training, developing and nurturing the resource talent to allow them to take on the truly big picture (strategic) vision for moving ahead and innovating.Concentration is on creating then putting out fires rather than smooth and organized processes that will prevent fires. It creates a rather herky-jerky (often counterproductive) work environment that is way overstressed when compared to productivity levels.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – "Forward Progress" is not always good; be willing to retreat from bad decisions.When measuring and acknowledging success give credit to those who accomplished it rather than only the manager; when measuring and remonstrating for failure, include management. You also need to hold manager accountable and require commitments; them committing other people does not count, they must commit themselves and the resources (personnel, physical, and physical) they are tasked with.Provide adequate (even minimal) training; saying that a resource will “pick it up as they go” is insufficient.You must measure performance against the job description into which people are hired.Provide succession planning and career path guidance.Temp to hire positions should be honored; hire your temps on when headcount opens instead of keeping a temp on and then hire someone else to fill the headcount. If they are good enough to keep, they are good enough to hire.</advice-to-management>

“Content provider that wants to be an innovative software developer but has no clue how to do it”

</title><pros>Pros – Very deep expertise in several lines of businessVery little micro management - employees encouraged to take ownership and accountabilityGood work life balanceOn the whole, good people who know their customers wellAdvancement opportunities if motivated to do so</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Insanely little collaboration among business units.  The company is a collection of acquisitions of legacy businesses.  Each of these businesses may as well be it's own company with it's own CEO.  Often, there will be three business units trying to solve the same problem under the same roof but there is ZERO collaboration or leveraging of common resources.-Poor management of dev resources.  Good luck executing on a product roadmap, multiple delayed or cancelled dev projects because of a lack of vision in deployment and management of dev resources.  Very difficult to make forward progress.-Company is often stuck in the model of being a content provider, whereas they talk the talk of innovation and cutting edge solutions.  In reality, no one knows how to develop solutions.-Poor leadership at the top.  Divisional manager came out of one of the acquisitions, very litle knowledge of other businesses and a tyrannical management style.  At company meeting, he told entire company "if you don't like your job find a new one...".  Many people listened to that advice.</cons>

“Great Product, Good Company”

</title><pros>Pros – This is a great product that has had massive growth over the last few years that will probably continue.  There are wonderful health benefits, great people to work with, and overall a commitment to a quality product.  My experience has been overall very positive as there is a commitment to helping those who are motivated succeed.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Decisions are made by a select few who do not necessarily fully understand the ramifications of the decisions they make.  This is a company that became very large very quickly, but still operates as if they are very small.  Changes do not occur quickly, and often the market perception of the company is of a rigid, arrogant, and inflexible company.  The perceptions are not necessarily true, but in business, market perception is reality.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – CCH is full of very professional and knowledgeable people.  It is an established company with solid operations.  The working environment is semi-casual and very laid back.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The benefits are pretty terrible. They hire many people as 'temps' so they can inflate their value per full time employee.  They also have a tendency to hire & fire temps with regularity.  The Riverwoods office is probably at 250% of capacity. Tiny cubes even for directors.</cons>

“Meat Grinder for College Graduates”

</title><pros>Pros – Paid overtime and decent quarterly bonuses mean compensation is good for an entry level position.Decent experience developing professional skills.401K and health insurance package.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The amount of time you are expected to work is punishing. In the Trademark Research you will routinely work 50-60 hour weeks and sometimes even more than that. You will eat lunch at you desk while you work because while technically you are given a half hour lunch there will be no time for it. Because of this, turnover is huge and management only maintains a staff as small as it possibly can. As a result, you are perpetually understaffed, perpetually overworked, and with no hope of it changing beyond advancing to a management position where they are actually able to leave at 5 most of the days of the week.99% of the feedback you will get for your work is negative. Your performance is a points-based system that you, essentially, only can lose points from. In addition the manager of the Quality Assurance team seems to enjoy humiliating researchers who have made mistakes and is extremely condescending.I could have dealt with one of these things, but not both. It ends up being an abusive environment.If you work for CT, save up all the money you will get from overtime, and start looking for a new job the moment you walk in the door and don't stop until you've found something.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Overstaff. Turnover is so high and the training period is so long that you need to overhire in order for current employees to feel any effect. If this results in not enough work to go around, then let employees voluntarily go home early. The current situation where they staff is eternally overworked will eventually spiral out of control when too many of your employees leave at once, and then your business will collapse because there is nobody to do the work.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – There have been cutbacks requiring most people to do the work of two to three. Management often not as experienced as those they manage and not willing to listen to people in the field. Constant demands to do projects without providing support needed to be successful.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It's kind of pointless to give advice because as a master plan is filtered down from below and you are just expected to accomplish it.

“Corporate Bureacracy changed company after acquisition”

</title><pros>Pros – - The small size of branch office made it easy to work and connect with people - The local management great with employees and was able to cut the red tape - Enjoyed the health benefits of  a large corporation.  Larger coporations tend to have better health and travel benefits that smaller or start up companies on a budget</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Affter acquisition main headquarters was distant from child company. - Took a long time to get approvals because of long processes - Employees with most experience and talents were not recognized - No room for growth</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – When you make a company acquisition, make sure you find out who has experience, longevity and knowledge in the company and make use that talent.  It seems that the company was not aware of the most valuable employees and allowed them to leave without finding a way to keep them.  It is hard to find good experienced people so it is in the companies best interest to hold on to talent.</advice-to-management>

“Great Benefits, That's About It”

</title><pros>Pros – Great Benefits.Casual work environment.Normally get to work as part of a team.Relatively easy job with good hours.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you are not a favorite, you will be treated like a second class employee.Executives are inconsistent and subscribe to the flavor of the month school of though.No clear career path, you get the feeling you will be stuck in your job forever.Feedback is seldom received, when it is, it is negative and non-constructive, based on perceptions of others as they are relayed to manager, not on direct observation.Management is risk averse, will avoid conflict at all possible junctures.Ability to think outside the box is often frowned upon, which stymies innovation.Communication between departments is non-existence, needs to be improved.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop stifling people who have an opinion that runs counter to what management wants to hear. There are a lot of dissatisfied people who work for the company who have been told by senior management to be quiet and stay in their lane. A lot of employees have a great deal of knowledge to share/offer that would benefit the end user. A great deal of work being done is duplicative.</advice-to-management>

“Run, Don't Walk Away from this Place”

</title><pros>Pros – WK has some of the best vacation (PTO) around and the company is very flexible about working from home whenever you need to. There are some really great and talented people working there.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The management is so bad at this place, it has a reputation of being toxic. So many colleagues would sit at their desks in tears for all the impossible workload given to them by upper management. The company's idea of making a profit is to cut people instead of investigating in the infrastructure necessary to transform from the print to the online space. The so out of touch decisions that management would make were nonsensical to those who they would ask to implement them. Horrible environment to work in.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Start investing in the infrastructure needed to succeed in the online space instead of just talking about it and starting and then stopping projects that go nowhere. Stop laying off people and asking the remaining employees to shoulder the burden of work--they're already at maximum capacity.

“An OK place to kill time while waiting for the Right Job to come through”

</title><pros>Pros – Benefits package was OK (not excellent), and approximately 30% of management were competent, respectful, and reasonable. Paid time off was very good: 20 days sick and vacation combined, plus 7 holidays. Some great people work for WK-Health, but the best don't stay.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Salaries are dreadful. Depending which group you work with, constant intense stress can be expected, or you may have problems filling your day. Zero personal development, almost zero growth potential. Most management personnel are arrogant, disrespectful, and blissfully unaware of what it means to produce what they are asking. Huge problems are simply tolerated and walked around, like the elephant in the room, because managers don't know how to solve problems...they apparently excel at Excel, and little else.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Recognize that the ones in the trenches matter for more than their output. Consider an advancement policy that's more than a popularity contest. Get rid of the dead wood; there are barely functioning employees with tremendous longevity that are making far more than newer hires who are producing 20x as much. Eradicate the offensive culture of arrogance that permeates the management levels.</advice-to-management>

“Employees pay personal price for poor management planning”

</title><pros>Pros – Since CCH makes tax/accounting software, and taxes are always with us, there will always be a need for the products CCH makes.Large company is full of diverse people from all over the world.</pros>
<cons>Cons – CCH is caught between an old industrial way of thinking (very top-down management) and the new guard who want "employee empowerment." So, if you show initiative, the first group will get angry at you for usurping their authority, and if you don't show initiative, the second group will say you're not adding value to the team.The company makes software, but is very behind the times technologically. Young hot shots who were brought in from other companies to try to modernize things all leave within a short period of time out of frustration.The company has bloated management that is poorly trained. The company doesn't pay enough to draw top talent, so even the high performing employees are only average compared to other places I've worked.Morale is very poor, mostly because the rank-and-file employees have a lot of responsibility without much control over their circumstances. The ridiculous amount of overtime hours has stopped in recent years because the economy is tight and the company has been affected by it -- so, basically, it stopped because they didn't want to pay it -- but the amount of work has not decreased. Recent reductions in force have made the amount of work worse.Most employees have very little flexibility about when/how/where they work. It's very much a "stay at your desk and work" environment.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get rid of the leads and managers who are only paying lip service to the high-performing teams initiative, without really believing/participating in it.Pay for top talent, and then DEVELOP that top talent to be good leaders.Stop implementing a new management philosophy every year. No one takes any of these new ideas seriously because we know next year you'll come up with something new.</advice-to-management>

“Glad It's Over”

</title><pros>Pros – Benefits are great including 20 days of PTO plus 13 paid holidays.  Company has been actively remodeling the Peterson location from it's 1950ies appearance.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Oh where to begin...  I'm not sure how the inside sales department was originally thought up, but by the time I left it had become a place that people were obviously miserable walking into each day.  The director of my group came from a collections department at a major credit card/banking operation and undoubtedly lacked a through knowledge of how to effectively motivate the sales teams.  Instead the mentality of success followed those of a telemarketing set up, ie. high # of dials, monitoring of employee activities, and fake appreciation of a job well done.  I want to mention that many on my team never approached management with recommendations/suggestions because we weren't take seriously or it would be used against us as why things are the way they are (based on a few people who had taken that initiative)The leads we called were routinely duplicated and assigned to multiple reps to call upon, and many times were also dead leads (literally dead people).   There was virtually no marketing of our product to potential customers, barely any partnership with state bar associations or other groups, and we were dominated by every single competitor in the industry as a result.  Sales were incredibly tough to achieve and you were definitely lucky if the customer didn't cancel in the 12 month cancellation window, otherwise it would go against your sales quota & commissions.  Quite a few on my team were in constant worry of being put on a performance plan, which didn't help the morale whatsoever.Additionally, there was definitely a feeling that my department didn't matter in the larger scheme of Wolters Kluwer considering division meetings rarely mentioned our team vs. the other departments within our division.  Also worth mentioning is the "sales trainer" has no sales background either which hinders their understanding of what challenges the team faced every single day.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Management, especially upper management has absolutely no clue as to what they are doing, how to motivate and lead their employees but instead are rude and threatening.  There is a lack of necessary tools so that employees can be most effective and do their jobs properly making it difficult to be happy with their positions across many job types within many of the WK divisions.  I say this because of what I have heard from other co-workers experiences that have worked in other divisions or from speaking with people from other parts of the company.  It is a large company so maybe not all parts of it are like that, but it does reflect on the company as a whole and can be compared to a dinosaur when compared to other similar companies.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Select only the highest quality in management with relevant experience so that they can perform the job duties required of them or the company will be failing itself as the employees under management will be unhappy, dissatisfied and will eventually leave the company for a better job experience.  Also ensure that promises are kept so employees do not lose trust in management and that the necessary tools are available so that everyone can win together.  Also, make it a priority to merge all the many systems together so that every one in the multiple departments are all on the same page.  For starters, focus on quality management and methods of evaluating management so that poor management styles or specific people do not negatively affect the company.</advice-to-management>

“Keep a hammer in your cubicle drawer- you'll need to hit yourself in the head with it quite often.”

</title><pros>Pros – Good work/life balance; immediate 4wks vacation right from start; Great reputation in the Tax/Accounting, Legal, and Banking/Mortgage arenas;</pros>
<cons>Cons – Senior Management is short-sighted and rife with cognitive dissonance- their bonuses are tied to Earnings and not Revenue, so they would rather cut headcount to make their numbers than actually put out quality platforms and grow organically; When your clients are your QA Team and find the majority of bugs and errors, its not a good thing- you can only tell them "You're a valued business partner, and we hope to have those bugs worked out soon" so many times before they catch on to the lie and realize that they're spending more time fixing OUR mistakes than using the platform ;  Sr. Management told employees that there would be a merit increase- but then reneged without any further explanation (Note: This is the SECOND YEAR IN A ROW that this has happened); You'll pay through the nose for your medical/dental benefits (EU company in the US); no matching 401(k); "Our Employees are our greatest asset- except when its time to recalibrate our human capital"...</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Attention Senior Management: YELLING and openly berating junior employees in a cubicle environment is not an acceptable form of motivation or management style; if you can't figure out why financial firms aren't spending money in 09-10, especially on overpriced platforms that do not deliver what is promised and continually crash, you're not long for this niche; Punishing /relieving your underpaid sales teams for not meeting your "What part of Fantasyland did these quotas come from?" numbers while not doing anything to improve your platforms is probably not your best move..... Chickenshit does not Chicken Salad make....</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Good co-workersNice locationDecent salary and benefitsGood if receding brand</pros>
<cons>Cons – Arrogant "clubby" self protective senior management with no opportunities for advancement of newer employees regardless of expertise or industry track records outside of CCH.Lack of respect for editorial staff and employees below executive team in general.Inequity of pay between editorial and business sides of company and senior execs versus employees in general.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Break up the "old boys club" and allow some fresh blood into leadership team before it's too late. Address pay and status inequities between editorial and business sides of company. Get real with the actual market situationand do something meaningful about it. Brand and product lines have been losing luster and market share for years but management continues business as usual. Ignores and spins market data as bad for morale or negativity even if it's raised in proper forums.</advice-to-management>

“Annual merit increase + market adjustment increase”

</title><pros>Pros – In the Customer Service Dept, I believe most employees like their job (in general).  I think we feel like management of our dept usually listens to our concerns. It was nice to get a market adjustment, but why isn't it based on the market we are moving to next month.</pros>
<cons>Cons – On recent annual reviews, some sections were graded as a whole dept which caused our grades to be lower.  This was our 'personal' evaluation - not the dept.  If merit increases are based on the grading system, the system has failed the employees who at least meet the goals set.  It is nice to receive a market adjustment because the company is moving to a more expensive county next month, but the amount is based on our office still being located in the current county - not the new county we are moving to.  Also, there is a good bit of nepotism and/or preferential treatment to certain races.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – If it is said that no employee can achieve a 5-Far Exceeds Expectations (or hardly received a 4-Exceeds Expectations when proof can be provided) on annual reviews -- Why don't you remove that option?</advice-to-management>

“Mixed Review”

</title><pros>Pros – A fair amount of independence in the day-to-day execution of work.  Interesting work with a constant learning curve.  The staff are really good people.  They are ethical, bright, and very intelligent. In short, a delight to work with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The negative aspects of working at WK centered around changes that were problematic.  Change communication was not always clear and concise.  But then, many times the actual changes that were made were not clear and concise.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Debrief employees who are leaving.  Or better still, ask employees who work directly with product maintenance and content acquisition to provide their best opinions on how to do their work.  Planning from a distance, in an abstract fashion, can lead to constructs that are flawed.Use intuitive interfaces whenever possible; they are usually the most successful.  Take the time to live with products to see what is "intuitive."  Focusing on whirlwind rapid change is just that, going in circles.And sometimes understanding a market or a customer requires that you be part of that market or a customer yourself.  Inside knowledge regarding what US professionals need requires staff living in the US.  Avoid cultural arrogance.  Balance respect for diversity with respect for the "gut understanding" insiders have for their own culture.  And be aware that this understanding needs to be included in the maintenance as well as the initial design and marketing for a successful product.</advice-to-management>

“CCH is a good place to work overall.”

</title><pros>Pros – CCH is the best company to work for in this industry. They invest in their products even when the economy is down. They continue to invest in their employees as well. There's an annual mid-year sales meeting where sales and marketing staff are flown in from all over to have an intense 3 days of training so they know the best way to sell and market their products. Compensation is fair. The benefits are great. Every employee starts with 20 days of paid time off. There is flexibility in telecommuting and even some in working hours. There are also several ways to get compensated for outstanding work through special project bonuses, a trip to Achievement Club, etc. There are also a lot of high quality people that work there.</pros>
<cons>Cons – CCH is a company that is very slow to change. There are two types of employees there -- ones that have been there 10+ years who don't embrace change and newer employees who want to find ways to improve processes, but continuously get told no. It also has a working environment where people are almost expected to be available after hours or when they are taking days off.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – When doing overall cost savings measures, including freezing some employees salaries, it would also be helpful to cut out unnecessary expenses like holiday parties. Also upper management has started to do a better job listening to employees, but more work needs to be done to show employees they have been heard.</advice-to-management>

“Going downhill”

</title><pros>Pros – Interesting work. Most of the regular workers (as opposed to management) are intelligent and care about their work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – For the past few years, competition with RIA has taken over the job-- people are no longer encouraged to do the best work they can. Instead, everything is a race to beat RIA's deadlines. CCH used to pride itself on providing a better product than RIA but now it's all about deadlines.</cons>

“Strong company core  competency, Weaker company Vision for Role”

</title><pros>Pros – Great people that like to have fun while getting work accomplished.  Strong confident position in the market place at the Tier 1 Accounting space.  Management appreciates it's people and is willing to work hard and long in order to be successful.  If you are willing to do the same you will fit right in.  CCH is a large organization but the accounting technology group operates like it's own start up...with cash.  The players are a good team of individuals that have been around for a while and they like to work hard as well as play hard.Compensation was on the short side of preferable but  great benefits, good training, great corporate events and outstanding people.  All interact if you make it so from the president of the division on down.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This role was developed to bring smaller market accounting firms into the fold and management was admittedly unclear on what the demographic for this role would be.  Guesses were ranged from firms with 1 to firms with 125 professionals.  Given CCH strong 98% market penetration in the tier 1 accounting space the cash cow was going away.  This was a technology position and management didn't seem certain on exactly how to go about pursuing the small/medium market firms.  Having sold a premium technology to firms that asked about price later, there was a disconnect in dealing with smaller firms.There was some minor static between the New Business people and the sales team that had been around a while -- natural nervousness due to the unknown but it was managed fairly well.  Eventually this role was phased into several existing positions.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Work a little harder on understanding your new markets.  Be more aggressive in allocating dollar and demographic specific resources to grow your new markets.  Remember that it will take a few years of outreach to gain back the trust of  a smaller market that your long established sales force has used a "take it or leave it" approach to sales regarding price.  Some good will must be established with that new market place before they will give you the time to persuade them on value.Other than that keep up the good work.  Good People.</advice-to-management>

“New Divisional Sales Manager is clueless and in over her head”

</title><pros>Pros – The product line for Tax and accounting research is very good.  Content rich and complete.  The new platform Intelli Connect could be good but was rolled out with problems</pros>
<cons>Cons – Expect to be a field sales rep in Texas for only three months.  They hired a person who has only been with CCH for a year and 1/2.  Her main concern is how she looks in front of Management.  Calls once a week and threatens to fire you.  Reminds me of that crazy girlfriend I had in high school.  She has gone through 7 people is 4 months wow!!!!!!  I understand it cost $25000 to replace an employee that's  $175,000 of wasted money</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Set up a program of rotating divisional managers in training.  They go work for 3 week s with a divisional manager and are reviewed by the divisional managers.

“lots of lip-service to "BDP" no leadership/strategy.  Clueless management.”

</title><pros>Pros – There are many talented and generous people in the business who work or have worked at WKH.  Flix time. The benefits are fair--though not enough to compensate for the lack of raises and opportunity to move up.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Constantly educating/updating/reporting leaves little time to improve the business.  Mangement  is always in flux--the new ones "learning the business" but then too busy reporting up to gain real insight into customer needs and how to meet them.  Reading other WK reviews across the country, I can see the constant reporting and budgeting and forcasting and reporting is epidemic as a waste of time and resources.</cons>

“Never Again!”

</title><pros>Pros – The PCI division of Wolter Kluwer is small and that translates into an opportunity to do a lot of different things and gather valuable experience.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is a lot of yelling and intimidation at this company.  Literally, meetings will include a lot of finger pointing and accusations of mistakes and failures.  This is seen as an acceptable management style which employees "get used to".Another key problem is the company is damaged goods in this economy.  Their main business is selling to mortgage companies and small banks -- which have taken a beating in the housing  and financial crisis.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop yelling and start listening.

“Work at CCH”

</title><pros>Pros – The benefit package included 401k matching and profit sharing plan, wide range of health insurance and dental care options. Generous vacation and time off allowance though both were combined into the same pool of days. Casual office environment, sometimes too casual as sweatpants and hooded sweatshirts were allowed.</pros>
<cons>Cons – First thing that you notice are how old and unkempt the place looks. Cubicles and carpets are old and worn, walls and doors need painting, office furniture is outdated and uncomfortable. Employee training is lacking, formal training on software and policies is fine, specifics of the jobs have to be learned from people who spent more time on the job and knowledge sharing is a real problem. Most seriously, higher management is dishonest about the goals and future direction and communications are uneven and sporadic. More worrying is utter dishonesty with which management handled process improvement, people who spent years developing and building the business were discarded like useless pieces of office furniture. Opportunities for advancements are limited, most get promoted from within by having connections and ears of sympathetic managers. Improvement to electronic infrastructure were undertaken when old systems could no longer be sufficient, getting help with computers or other office equipment required calls to outsourcers, problems often were not resolved for days.</cons>

“Company stuck in outdated employer-employee relations.”

</title><pros>Pros – Work-life balance.  Good name to have on resume.  Excellent teammate relations.  Four weeks PTO and great benefits.</pros>
<cons>Cons – First of all, CCH facilities are completely outdated and gross.  For a company posting profits like they are, they should be able to pump some money into their offices.  Other downsides include nepotism, favoritism, and being misled on advancement opportunities.  Management is absolutely most concerned about their paychecks vs. how to create a great atmosphere for their employees.  A lot could be done to boost productivity, say sales contests and recognition for a job well done, but there is a serious lack of these ideas.  A little goes a long way for employees who feel appreciated.Also as a sales rep with CCH, I saw plenty of sales channel conflict.  Field Sales Reps are the precious babies of CCH while other sales personnel don't matter nearly as much.  CCH is willing to pay FSRs a great amount of money towards their commissions, so if you're looking at outside sales, this would be a good fit.  All other sales professionals in the company won't see nearly as much money.I would also say this company currently has the mentality that it's an employers market and anyone who doesn't agree can go work elsewhere.  CCH could be revolutionary with it's attitude to the workforce, but it chooses to hold on to outdated ideas.</cons>

“The concensus-driven large-scale Holding Company model - Recipe for Madness....”

</title><pros>Pros – Despite some routine upheavals common to all major corporations, it's actually a fairly stable place if you aspire to be at Director level or below.  Most VP's and above get shot or otherwise attritted on a regular basis, typically 2 years, then out.  The better career strategy in this place is to stay one notch lower, and stay off the radar, and then stay for many years.  There is little incentive to jump to the higher levels here.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The place is absolutely obsessed about their insane BDP's (business development plans) and budgets. They spend 9 months each year arguing what the numbers should be for the next year and initiating various cuts, instead of growing the business, grooming people and taking entrepreneurial risks.  Then they start the insanity all over again 3 months later.  It's a protracted disease like nothing you've ever seen anywhere, and is driven by a Dutch finance spendthrift mentality that all other companies have abandoned 50 years ago.  It is not really a corporation at all, just a loose group of companies running wild, with a deep fear of any central control and fearful of any change.  The few folks who are in the central control spots are fearful of exercising any power or authority for fear of losing their jobs, and tend to just go with the flow and make least common denominator decisions that offend no one.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get some good strong leaders who make fast and powerful decisions, and then back them up. Stop rolling over to what every business unit wants and exercise some strong central control.  The shared services part of the company seems like it might be uniquely positioned to run all the business units, instead of being their lapdog, and should be moved up the org chart accordingly.</advice-to-management>

“Decent company, but easy to fall into a stagnation trap”

</title><pros>Pros – WKFS is a typical very large company. They pay is competitive for the area. The environment is steady, not much confusions about what your job is. A lot of maintenance  work on very old products that still are doing well in the marketplace. Keep your head down, do you work and you'll be fine and get a decent paycheck. There is a decent catered in lunch everyday. The people are generally friendly. The benefits are good, they give you an above average 4 weeks of vacation from the day  you start. Seemed to me to be a generally well run place.</pros>
<cons>Cons – WKFS is a typical very large company. There are a variety of people with different skill levels who work there, but lot of them are people who are looking for their steady paycheck and have stagnated in terms of career advancement. It is very easy to get stuck in a niche job and stay there for years. Their system for evaluating employees seems to change every year. I got the sense management simply had no idea which of their employees were quality, high skilled people and which were cubicle drone dolts.  A large new software development project seemed to be floundering because no one really knew its purpose.</cons>

“Caveat employee”

</title><pros>Pros – Large company, good benefits, opportunities for advancement if you change your specialty. They have worldwide offices and appeal to the highly skilled marketing person. They have a lot of little perks, like company-sponsored lunches and parties. Their health benefits are above average both in what is covered as well as out-of-pocket cost to employees. They have a fairly generous profit-sharing program, based on a percentage of annual salary. They only require a 37.5 hour workweek and pay most technical employees an annual salary. They offer 24 days of vacation (the parent company is Europe-based so they follow the European idea of lots of 'vacation' time) for new salaried employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Large company doesn't really feel loyal to employees, although they expect absolute loyalty upwards. They are currently in a situation where the parent company, Wolters Kluwer, is demanding a fairly high return on investment; the last year I worked there it was 18%, which is very difficult to maintain in their market segment. They have twice (and, I understand, yet again) cut positions or, in my case, out-sourced positions to fatten the bottom line to try to meet their goals. They also do not give very much feedback to employees regarding contemplated employment changes. For example, in December I was told my job was safe, and in January it was out-sourced.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Flexability and ooportunity to contribute. Wolters Kluwer is a very large orgnization, however they are strucutured into smaller market focused business unit. There are differences in culture from one business unit to the next. The financial services unit is great place to be if you are market focused and like to effect change. This unit has proiven over the past couple years that it is nimble and flexiable enough to respond to market conditions and change in ways that make the most sense for the business.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Large organization that can be difficult to understand and navitgate at corporate level. However, consolidation fo information sources is making this easier.</cons>

“Great products with a tangled brand/sales structure”

</title><pros>Pros – Growing company with many business units that offer broad experience and geographic opportunities.  The Amsterdam HQ does try to make sure all associates are updated.  So they send out regular communications and expect the GMs to do the same.  They do seem to try to present a balanced view of the business, with some challenges/bad news mixed in.   They also have many opportunities to telecommute.  The benefits are great and kick in quickly.  The offices in NY are in Chelsea, right in the heart of all that is cool and hip.  They also have opportunities/offices all over the US, so best bet is to just look at their jobsite for what is open at any moment in time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Structure of company is a bit cumbersome with business units competing for business against each other.   This leads to a lot of frustration for the sales teams who find out from customer prospects that one sales rep from another branch is misinforming them about their product/service.   Marketing strategy is very hard to develop as well since you are tripping up against the other WK service offerings.  There was also for me a sense that the managers were working in isloation of each other, rather than getting a feeling that they all were pulling together with a common vision and goal.  A bit of "every man for himself."</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Align products and services to customer groups.   Stop confusing the customer with the many branches of Wolters Kluwer.</advice-to-management>

“Could be a rising star... or a bust.”

</title><pros>Pros – As a business publisher, not a consumer driven org WK has tremendous opportunity.  The potential for out of the box growth and personal contributions is high IF you land in an area where the executive team has political clout.  Many of the publishing areas are mature, but have solid business plans to reach sizable growth objectives.  As an executive, there are opportunities to move among the divisions and find upward career growth through the talent management program.</pros>
<cons>Cons – A company who lives in the shadow of the much larger competitors of Thomson and Elsevier but who COULD be more aggressive, creative, and agile than those other publishers.  The Health division in particular is suffering from competitive envy.  There they dont make a move before the rest of the industry.  The executive team is self absorbed and lacks leadership /motivational skills.  The Health division is a hive of political connections and entitlements.  There is constant misdirection and sleight of hand by the division execs who are caught up in fads and misplaced priorities -- like the unhealthy obsession with Six Sigma, without a real sense of its value or purpose.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Focus!  Stop trying to be the "next big thing" and earn your way to a lead position with content by embracing the inherant strength of the staff and the wealth of knowledge held by the business units' management.</advice-to-management>

“Not worth working here”

</title><pros>Pros – You will be working in regulatory reporting solutions as regulatory space is catching up fast these days in financial services industry</pros>
<cons>Cons – 1) They hired many experienced ppl w/o even knowing where to fit them in the organization.2) They show you all sort of benefits while joining, but once you join you don't get what you are promised. Ex: Bonus payout was promised by HR it is 95% almost all the time, where as it only 50%.3) They  hire experienced ppl of more than 6-7 yrs as Business analyst and make them work as technical analyst.As most ppl over here are from banks, they don't know what is the role of business analyst so they make undue advantage of it.4) Mgmt over here don't know how to handle customer issues. They just dump on you and expect you to do by end of day even if they assign you the issue at 6.30pm.5) If you are hired as associate business analyst then you will be good for nothing. You will doing data entry job in their reporting platform.6) They make you variable pay look big but actually you will get peanuts in terms of variable pay.7) NO customer interaction or travel opportunities at customer place.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – 1) hire those ppl who have some qualification to be at top management, instead taking ppl who have relatives over here in comp.2) Define role and responsibilities and hire those who can fit in the organization structure and explain the same to new ppl joining the comp.3) Stop taking ppl from banks , ultimately this is a s/w product based company.</advice-to-management>

“Professional Slave”

</title><pros>Pros – It's a great place when it comes to the work life balance and flexibility. It is also a good start pay for the new graduates.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Nothing here is good besides the flexibility:- Management invest more on systems than they do on the employees- Budget is the only issue they are concerned about- Everything is tried to be globalised forgetting the local culture- The managers never concerned about the grassroots and only act upon as they are told- All tals and no action on improvement of quality for employees- The annual increment is less than 2% and bonus is a laughing matter- We are a shared services but the profit made overseas is not shared locally for our efforts- The local director has their own goals and aims and is so self-centered- Environment is more silent than a cemetary- There is no value to employees - kick you when not needed</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Location right by Sheppard Subway Station. Lots of opportunity to get hands-on experience with duties/responsibilities outside of your role's scope. For the most part, friendly peer co-workers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Terrible upper management. U.S. doesn't care about Canadian operations because revenues are too small. Oblivious, bullying, mentally checked-out VP on the legal and business side--rampant favoritism not based in actual achievement. No future for the industry and no new ideas. Leadership vision and lack of execution is the most serious problem here. No willingness to invest time and resources in proper, thorough research to validate new product ideas.</cons>

“Great people, international environment”

</title><pros>Pros – Great mission - what Wolters Kluwer does really contributes to makng the world a better place, by helping professionals. The people are generally really professional, intelligent, and team oriented - overall nice to work with. Being part of an international organization. Focus on innovation and using the latest technologies to create the best products. Movement for growth - I have felt very supported in my career aspirations and growth. CEO Nancy McKinstry is an inspiration - she really came up from within the organization (started in sales!). Great gender diversity - 2 of 4 of the the globaldivisions are headed by women.</pros>

Other than meeting their standards in these 6 months, there is no job security whatsoever. If you don't reach the standards, and they don't think you will, you will get the boot. Unnecessary pressure. Work has to be absolutely perfect during the probation period. No open communication between the team who reviews your work and you. Good luck in keeping your sanity.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Fair salary and OK benefits</pros>
<cons>Cons – Job security lacking. Spread too thin trying to keep to many products going resulting in all products being mediocre. Upper management has not chosen under managers who are dedicated to the company or products resulting in bad management of those under them and poor plans and decisions for the future. Will have to divest some products (along with cutting jobs) to regain focus on the few successful products they have. Employees are the first to suffer from lack of focus because raises and profit sharing (for nonmanagement at least) are regularly not given due to "poor economy"</cons>

“Overall, it has been a positive experience but the slow-pace of the industry and company makes me restless.”

</title><pros>Pros – Work-life balance - time outside work for your own hobbies, family, activities. Great people to work with - attracts people who are not as ambitious or who take part in politicking, who are friendly, and who respect each other. Very open to job rotation for exposure and learning especially for longer-term employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Remuneration (increments and bonuses) is not competitive. Can stifle those who are ambitious and who want to grow very quickly. Rather slow-paced industry combined with a company who wants to change and innovate but is rather sluggish in doing so. Can get used to slower pace and feel complacent to jump back in the rat race if the opportunity presents itself from another company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Departments need to have better and more honest communication and teamwork - currently very diplomatic but loses cutting edge execution. Requires far stronger mentorship and leadership development structure and processes. Although innovation is a key focus, change and ideas are still very slow in being explored and implemented - needs greater investment of resources and management support to succeed.</advice-to-management>

“Wait here while you look for the right job”

</title><pros>Pros – 1. Relatively stable workplace, with good (if quiet) atmosphere.2. People in Production are nice (up to a certain hierarchical level at least).3. Good work ethics and culture.4. Fresh grads gain good work skills via training.5. Relatively good starting pay and benefits.</pros>
<cons>Cons – 1. Zero recognition of high performers - do exceptionally well (beyond job requirements) and it's what they pay you for; fall short (even for reasons beyond your control) and your head rolls. The supposedly prestigious "Wall of Fame" is practically a popularity contest; winning it gets you a puny voucher, and then it's back to work. Many employees who keep things running smoothly day in, day out go unnoticed and unrewarded.2. Bleak advancement prospects - it's basically a dead-end job environment unless you're looking to go into corporate management, and even then the opportunity to advance only comes up when someone resigns or gets promoted. And even then, some openings are directly given with a pretend advertisement for applicants.3. Non-existent salary increases - salary gets raised by less than 2% yearly, no matter how long you've been here or how good you are at your job. If it gets raised, that is.4. Poor management - one former HR consultant aptly put it: "Management will basically treat you like factory workers." Retention is non-existent on the management's agenda. They prefer to hire cheap fresh grads rather than retain experienced staff by increasing rewards and recognitions.5. Immature managers - a lot of people leave due to a small number of immature managers who were never meant to manage people. Among known issues are pushing for too much output from too few employees, playing yes-person to editorial and expecting high performance from over-worked staff. Until the powers that be deal with this issue, turnover will never drop.6. Meaningless surveys - there are a lot of surveys every year on workplace issues, employee happiness, etc, but constantly raised issues are never addressed year in, year out. Employees give a lot of feedback that are not acted upon. The jaded cynics are those who've been here for a few years - the optimistic and happy are usually fresh grads happy to have a job.7. Reluctance to invest - the company is always trying to make do with what it's got despite constantly trying to grow it's market (read: workload for staff). As a result, current employees are always seeing more and more workload, without a similar increase in pay or benefits.8. Unrealistic expectations - many new hires are given a strict period for learning the ropes, disregarding the human factor that leads to different learning abilities. Some of the best current employees (hired before the strict confirmation conditions were in place) took much longer to become good at what they do.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Talk to the people at the bottom, especially in Production, and find out what's making them want to leave, then deal with the issues.For every resigning employee, there are two who are actively job-hunting.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – #1 or #2 in most market sectors.Very knowledgeable folks make this place hum!Almost everyone is very nice and fun to work with.Fantastic PTO, 401k, etc.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Senior management competencies are out of synch with strategic direction set by top management.Bureaucracy can be numbing some days.Unable to bob and weave strategically.Almost everything not outlined in a manual (of which there are many long ones) it takes eons longer than it does at other companies.Slow and methodical to a fault.Really stinky marketing for a frontrunner.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – In order to meet the challenges and opportunities in our various markets, we need to move faster and more decisively. Older CCH Managers  are stifling change and growth - although I am not sure if they know it, or how you would go about finding that out. We need to invest in serious marketing in our niches as well as product development. Challenge Holland on this!</advice-to-management>

“CCH, lots of potential, but...”

</title><pros>Pros – Good compensation and benefits for the sales staff. Most products offer great content. Lots of PTO available even for new employees. Great people to work with. Product prices are OK, but could be more reasonable.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Because CCH is owned by Wolters Kluwer, the company is a victim of constant budgetry cuts and decisions that don't relate to the real world. Frankly, if Wolters Kluwer were to leave CCH alone, it would probably be a better company to work for. However, CCH, like many companies these days, is being squeezed by a larger international company that is only looking out for the investors and not the interests of the employees or the customers. Mid level managers are not telling high level managers the truth about what's really going on with the company on the front lines. It is the classic left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. The sales department in particular is in constant disray because CCH constantly reorganizes its database when it comes to assigning accounts to sales people. Customers fall through the cracks. Long-term customer rapport and relationships are lost because accounts are constantly reassigned by some cookie cutter approach cooked up by a Wolters Kluwer employee in the Netherlands who has no idea what sales is really about. One minute retention is important and the next minute new sales is the new flavor of the month. The company needs to equally focus on both retention and new sales. CCH needs to spend less time acquiring new companies and more time working with the employees and products they already have acquired over the years. Employees are dragged into too many meetings and bombarded with too many internal meaningless e-mails. Each department appears to be going into different directions based on its respectively compensation packages rather than the overall good of the employees, customers or the company in general. A decision in one department can adversely affect the performance of another department with little notice or warning. The company has a lot of potential, but keeps shooting itself in the foot.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You claim in a recent press release that CCH is customer focused. Saying you are customer focused is like Fox News constantly telling its viewers it is a fair and balance news company. Don't tell customers you are customer focused, just be customer focused. Stop changing and redesigning the sales department - just get back to basics with sales, customer relations and rapport. Rearranging the deck chairs of sinking ship doesn't stop the ship from sinking.</advice-to-management>

“Not so good”

</title><pros>Pros – Good benefits and laid back work atmosphere</pros>
<cons>Cons – Incompetent and under qualified staff - QA especially. Being in a place like Wichita KS doesn't help CCH find very qualified candidates and unwillingness to pay average industry salary makes it even harder. People who join and are good move on after gaining some experience for more money and growth.Lack of recognition and growth. Most of the managers and leads are people who have worked for the company for over 20 yrs.Very slow development pace, and salaries below industry averageToo many changes each year: we haven't even seen results of the last change yet and we are already trashing it to move to a new process.</cons>

“A Lack of Vision...”

</title><pros>Pros – Good Benefits, 4 Weeks PTO, Decent Health/Dental Benefits, Good Financial Backing. Multiple locations & departments. Cross-department opportunities once you get in.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Being a publicly held organization in europe, the executive leadership at WKFS is totally missing the mark. This company is clueless when it comes to product vision and strategy. Its all about net EBIDA earnings and year after year, they will eliminate head count come Q2-Q3 to meet annual earnings. Executive management could care less about things like nurturing good talent, product vision & strategy.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Learn something from Apple - the best product organization in the world. Focus on building the best product there is. The entire executive management structure needs to be re-shuffled and someone with a more substantive background/experience running software/information services/technology companies should be brought in. The current management structure is way too heavily weighted on printing experience and background.</advice-to-management>

“Stale environment moving too slow in a fast paced industry”

</title><pros>Pros – Almost a month PTO for new hiresGood benefitsCommission can be lucrativeA very organized person will find themselves with little to do to themselves successful</pros>
<cons>Cons – Stagnant advancementNo formal employee reviewVery low base pay making for wild fluctuations in comp throughout the yearFSRs have too many products to work their entire product list wellASRs are asked to manage 800-1200 accountsProducts are overpriced year after year, and often under performProducts are designed with Top tier firms in minds but the sales force is asked to force prices onto very small local cpa firms, who honestly will never have a need for their products</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get reports from the front line sales people.  If your customers, sales people, and the industry as whole say your prices are too high, as your products slowly slip down in the pack with your competitors, then your opinion of your products don't matter, the reality of the martketplace has changed.  You will eventually have to change with it.Standardize your processes, you have entirely too many customers to have your people dealing with one-off situations constantly.Promote and bring in new people, the old guard is holding on to some bad habits and the sales and back office as a whole needs new blood to compete.</advice-to-management>

“Run, save yourself!”

</title><pros>Pros – The paid time off is much better than average.Casual dress code most of the timeIt's better than starving to death.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is terribleNo opportunity for advancementCertain facilities managed by terrible managersOutdated management methodologiesAll 'stick', no 'carrot'.No employee career or improvement trainingEmployees treated as faceless, replaceable cogs.Short term fixes only.  So much time is fighting fires, and none is spent preventing them.Annual "Merit Increases" are pegged to a facility average (3.0) so there is no ability to be rewarded for performing well.Some facility managers skew reviews down, apparently believing that there is no such thing as a 5 and that 4 would be something like curing cancer (on a 1-5 scale).Concept of employee freedom foreign to facility management.No communication between facilities.  Different departments rarely know what the other is doing.Unreasonable, sometimes mathmatically impossible goals/deadlines/service levels.A strong tendency towards presenting good metrics, instead of actually doing things right.Poorly designed/engineered facilities.Management makes promises it either can't or doesn't intend to deliver.Due, in part, to directives and culture from WK Intl, it is incredibly hard to increase headcount, even when all evidence indicates that a group is very understaffed.Little investment in future.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Insure that those running facilities have not set up their own kingdoms.  Review, holistically, pay scales, job requirements, and such.  Come to an understanding that there are deep problems within the organization and that it will take time and money to correct them.  Invest in long term solutions, not quick fixes.</advice-to-management>

“False hope from upper management for a better workplace environment”

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to the employees or trends.  If an office has a lot of resignations then ask why. Employees resigned due to current management (my guess is they are still there and they were never dealt with) and salary (do the new replacement employees make more?  a lot more? are they worth it????) .</advice-to-management>

“Good for a short stop if you need a job, otherwise look for better opportunities”

</title><pros>Pros – Some hardworking, well intentioned people at mid, lower levels.  Commute is OK if the office is nearby.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Sr. management has shown little vision or results in running the business.  One of the larger divisions (which includes PCi) is run by an entrepreneur who build a $35 million rev business, sold it to WK big $, and then stayed on to run the business.  He was promoted to run other businesses, which is a joke.  He has no feel into the other business units, manages by intimidation because he fires people on a whim if they disagree with him on points.  He keeps a small team of loyal people around him who 'yes' him to death, and tell him he is the greatest.  He has never run a business other than his own since he left business school, and it shows.  Most people ask why he hasn't taken his money and left, but he probably stays on because he makes more than anyone else would surely pay him.  His HR 'business partner' team is a joke, mainly interested in making sure they avoid lawsuits from disgruntled and poorly treated former employees.</cons>

Flexible hours and work-from-home contribute to health work/life balance. Strong benefits. Pleasant work environment and friendly atmosphere. Mostly qualified employees and managers.</pros>

Very slow in accepting and adapting to the advent of electronic and interactive media - people don't want to buy $300 textbooks any more!

“Good benefits, good people, below average pay, very little room for advancement, very little money for training”

</title><pros>Pros – People, time off, very few weeks over 40 hours, low stress.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Below average wages, no money invested in training employees, little room to advance, tendency to fall behind in pay if you're there for a number of years, Senior management strongly believes that off-shoring and outsourcing save money, when in fact the numbers just don't add up.  As with most companies, there is very little value placed on experience and business knowledge.  Employees are not replaced as they leave.  Instead, other employees share the burden or the work is sent to India.  Middle management understands the pros and cons to outsourcing but has little say and no guts.  Offshore and onsite consultants come and go.  So much time is wasted on bringing new ones up to speed.  These consultants are very young and entry level and are not gurus.  Senior management perceives full-timers as replaceable and less skilled than their offshore counterparts - though in reality the opposite is true.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Senior management - listen to your middle managers.  They have a ton of insight but very little gall.  In this era of little job security, no one wants to make waves.  Outsourcing works well for some things but very poorly for others, and you need to recognize when it just doesn't work.</advice-to-management>

“Stay away! Toxic environment and getting worse!”

</title><pros>Pros – There is some flexibility when it comes to work life balance.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This company at one point had the potential to be ok. But the yelling, the attempt at intimidation, the lack of respect for employees, and executive leadership that is incompetent, will lead them to complete demise unless the President and CEO is fired and new leadership comes in and brings in an entirely new executive team. There is simply no other way. They cut and cut and cut to get to numbers they want to report, with no strategic plan for growth and everything has suffered with no end in sight. Marketing and Innovation the true cornerstones of a growing company are non existent, and completely unsupported. Product management blames sales for not selling the product, this has been going on for 5 years, and sales has changed so many times and new strategies attempted, guess what? It's not sales THE PRODUCTS SUCK! If you were producing things the market wanted they would buy, how simple is that? If you want to be frustrated, lied to, not given respect for the experience you bring to the table and be part of a failing company join Wolters Kluwer Financial services. You will wake up every day hating your life until the day you get out.</cons>

International conglomerate - Wolters Kluwer- provides potential for world-wide opportunities. Fascinating and worthwhile industry (medical information services/publishing).</pros>

“Stay away from this place”

</title><pros>Pros – -Some wonderful folks work in Wolters kluwer. The company is very flexible about working from home. Benefits and salary is reasonable but the good points are overshadowed by the cons.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The attitude of Senior management to the staff is horrible. Long hours and constantly micro managed. Politics is rife as a small circle of management try to beat each other and their staff up trying to climb the corporate ladder.  Feedback is never listened to and any sort of praise never happens. The majority of decisions come from the US these days and the attitude towards non US based employees is really bad. The technology is years behind and the infrastructure is falling apart. Overall the worst company by far in my entire career.</cons>

“Wolters Kluwer US”

</title><pros>Pros – The executive leadership of Wolters Kluwer have developed a sound strategy for maintaining or attaining lead positions within the various markets in which it competes.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Multiple staff reductions over the past few years has left remaining staff accountable for more responsibilities than can be maintained at prior levels of quality and competency. However the company has begun to rebuild staff numbers with new hires better suited to the changing work.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep the current division executive leaders in place for longer than 18 months to provide much needed stability and continuity. They are doing a good job and employees want to execute for them.</advice-to-management>

“Hard to get work done due to internal dynamics and bureaucracy.”

</title><pros>Pros – 5bn$ company, good products in the Information Services space, significant acquisitions. The Financial Services arm is better than the others in terms of working environment.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lot of internal dynamics, Very hard to get good work done,  Autocratic management style, Very little positive reinforcement when doing a good job, Lack of infrastructure, Steady layoffs as a result of offshore initiative. Acquired organizations have not integrated well into the company resulting in a lot of intra-unit politicking. There is no clarity on roles & responsibilities of acquired units. Each acquired unit has its own culture, including a widely differing holiday schedule. Not much in the way of processes. Chicago downtown office lacks basic facilities & infrastructure. Incompetent IT Support services vendor (outsourced) takes ages to resolve minor issues.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management needs to cultivate a spirit of bon homie within the company by using a mix of carrot and the stick instead of using the stick all the time. Spend more time on redefining & streamlining processes instead of micro-managing operations.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – Thinks like a publishing company. Expectations from health care information technology vendors are high, wolters kluwer health does not cut it.

</title><pros>Pros – Very laid back, great benefits, easy-going management, good locations, easy work</pros>
<cons>Cons – Too lax management, don't seem to care what you do, inadequate communications and training. Managemen isn't around and leaves everything up to you. They have people there that truly do not care about their jobs but collecting checks and they are never let go. You can literally come and go as you please, no one is watching anything you do.

“Good benefit package except expensive health insurance option.  Expected to work 60-80 hours per week for few months.”

</title><pros>Pros – Benefit package - a lot of PTO if you are allowed to take them all and profile sharing plan is one of the highlight.  Your hard work may be rewarded by nominate to attend achievement club which can spend few days vacation on company's expense.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You will expect to have long hours of work and stressful work environment.  Management may put you in panic mode intentionally so you can get the job done quicker and burn you out quicker.  Many newly hired managers are clueless - as long as you know how to play politic, you can be in management team.  Always has excellent process on paper to improve work but never get executed or interpreted correctly.</cons>

“Good place to work if you never want to do anything different - ever..”

</title><pros>Pros – Good benefitsGood payLots of training and resources available</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lack of promotion opportunity.  Each year you ask for a promotion, you will be given a list of what needs to be done to get there.  Then, once you have completed those things nothing will happen, and when your review comes around (and you ask about a promotion once again) you will be given a new list of things you need to accomplish first.  Even if you routinely outperform the vast majority of others in your position.Upper management short-sightedness.  More and more over the last few years the company has been moving with the new trend to make things look pretty in the very, very, short term scenario.  Even if those strategies are detrimental to the future."Flavor of the Month" mentality.  Whatever is the chosen product of the moment (usually one that was poorly planned, implemented, and rolled out by the company and is not doing well as a result) is, if it is not doing well it is blamed on the front line.  Your desk can be raking in revenue, but if "x" number of your clients haven't gotten on board with "insert chosen product here", you might as well be invisible.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – CT used to value their employees and have success with a philosophy of hiring talented people, providing them with the right resources, keeping them happy, and then letting them do their jobs.  Having quality, well trained, motivated employees that aren't weighed down by micro-management, complicated compensation packages, lack of recognition for "big picture" success, and lack of management support is what resulted in a high quality service product to the client.Less games and frills and more focus on the big picture and the value of quality employees that are kept happy.</advice-to-management>

“Good experience, low salary”

</title><pros>Pros – Managers provided many opportunities to staff for small advancements and chances to take on increasing responsibility. A lot can be learned about publishing from working at such a large company. Also, the work-life balance was great: I was never expected to work evenings or weekends.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's a problem in most of publishing, but editorial salaries were low as compared with many other industries. It could have taken 10 years to achieve a significantly higher paying position, and I wasn't allowed to work overtime.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep giving lower-level employees opportunities to lead and to increase their level of responsibility, but allow better salary increases for those who are talented and willing to put in extra hours.</advice-to-management>
