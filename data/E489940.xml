“Awesome”

</title><pros>Pros – Dr. Plover is a small private practice specializing in Family Medicine. She treats her employees with the same caring concern she affords her patients. Truly a joy to work with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Unfortunely, due to the small scale of the practice, there are no health benifits or retirement plan incentives  available at this time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Dr. Plover gives selflessly to both her patients and the team that affords her the opportunity to practice medicine using a non-managed care model. Her dedication is infectious. My advice? Continue to provide supportive leadership - we've got your back.</advice-to-management>
