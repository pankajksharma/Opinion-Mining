<title>

“It's like working in any fast-paced, high-end restaurant, except they expect you to do everything at once.”

</title><pros>Pros – Nice atmosphere, relaxing at times, little supervision, it's very repititive, sometimes there are occasional breaks, some really nice employees, chef makes a killer meal if you come in as a customer, you can be late and it's usually ok (unless there's a big event going on).</pros>
<cons>Cons – Chef has high standards, so it can sometimes be hard to please everyone at onceSometimes manager gets upset with stressNeed to be available on-callEasy to mess up (very high standards)Very difficult when understaffed (manager makes scheduling mistakes)Really bad bathroomVery few breaks</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Q Haute is a great place to work, but sometimes employees are given too much of a burden when the restaurant is understaffed.  I would recommend to the management to work on scheduling more employees comsistently in order to quicken service and to ease employees.</advice-to-management>
