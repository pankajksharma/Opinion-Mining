“Don't get sick”

</title><pros>Pros – Specific open and close times. Consistent lunch schedule.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very rigid sick and vacation time. If you have sick children or get sick yourself you can expect to be fired if you need more time off. I had a child needing surgery and I was let go due to the recuperation time off request.</cons>
