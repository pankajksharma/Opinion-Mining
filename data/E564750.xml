“Management Treatment”

</title><pros>Pros – This company has a good reputation with seniors and disability clients.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The main office at Margaret Place is outdated and dirty. Nobody dusts, cleans carpets, etc.  Very outdated place.  Depressing place. The management teams only care about themselves and their positions. They steal your ideas and call them their idea. They have a reputation of firing employees.  Large turnover. They treat the employees like workers and that's it.  Benefits were just ok. Nothing to brag about.  Management has terrible values and work ethics.  The company only cares about clients and customers and not employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Not sure what to say here. This place needs help. It is getting worse.</advice-to-management>
