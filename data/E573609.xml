“Not a good experience”

</title><pros>Pros – Learned some good skills, saw how to not run an organization, good exposure to the struggles of a small non-profit. I was given some cool projects but after awhile it felt like work for the sake of keeping me busy.</pros>
<cons>Cons – sketchy work, little transparency, they make you do a bunch of work and never actually use it, unknown funders, little effort to engage younger staff, make workers feel like there replaceable, extremely poor management style.  This was a good experience until I my work was placed to the side for a year, then used without giving me any credit.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Treat your employees with more respect.</advice-to-management>
