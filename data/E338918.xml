</title><pros>Pros – none. Well, I suppose getting tips helped some. At the time, they seemed to want to have a fun time running their business, so they may have improved since I left.</pros>
<cons>Cons – too many to really count. Besides the unlawful way in which you got paid (I never got a paystub!) and the "high school" like attitude of the owners.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Rearrange your whole way of thinking. Sadly, you guys have decent food, but to work there was more than I could stand. Since I stopped working there, I have never once gone in to buy food. I haven't eaten their food since I stopped employment solely for my morality.</advice-to-management>
