“Great learning opportunity”

</title><pros>Pros – Learn much about video editing and media production. Also, hands on experience with video camera's during live sporting events.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hours are limited and very competitive, restrained by the amount of sporting events throughout the year.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Allow for a two or three day learning session where employees can gain hands on experience before they are thrown into an event. When I was employed, I had prior experience. Although, others did not, which took them time to adapt to things.</advice-to-management>
