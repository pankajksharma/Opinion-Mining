“Good Place to Work”

</title><pros>Pros – Good benefits, atmosphere, and employees. Objectives are clearly outlined and expected to be met. There is plently of room for questions to be asked, and lessons to be learned.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not a lot of room for career advancement. This is a small firm, but a great place for someone who is just starting out in the tax or audit world. Would also be an ideal place for someone who is looking to retire.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
