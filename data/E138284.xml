<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management should work harder to identify exceptional talent and do what they can to help advance their careers within the organization, rather than waiting until someone is frustrated, unhappy or has been offered another opportunity elsewhere.</advice-to-management>

“Never a dull moment...”

</title><pros>Pros – Great mission and very dedicated staff; people are friendly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Extremely aggressive with constant deadlines; not a 40 hrs/wk job no matter what position you're in. If you want to be a comfortable level with your work, be prepared to come early/stay late. Meetings happen all the time -People have meetings about things that can be assigned/conveyed via email. Training/onboarding to internal processes is very lacking as well.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You need to really evaluate workload and maybe hire staff so people aren't constantly overwhelmed.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
