“Great company!!!”

</title><pros>Pros – L'BRI is by far the best direct sales company I have worked for.  They care about their associates.  And on top of everything I get to share these wonderful products with others.  I have never seen a product as great as L'BRI.  My customers feel the same way.  Makes me feel great when a customer tells me how wonderful and great their skin looks and feels!!!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Wish they would go live with the new website.  Direct sales can be a tough business.  Nothing to do with L'BRI.  I just need to figure out how to get shows and recruits.  Want to retire from my full-time job and do my L'BRI full time.</cons>
