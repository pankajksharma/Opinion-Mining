“Knights of Columbus!”

</title><pros>Pros – It was great!  I was able to see all kinds of ideas for weddings/showers/corporate parties.  I just loved it! I would recommend it to anyone!</pros>
<cons>Cons – It was a weekend job.  The hours were late and it was Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday morning usually.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I don't have any advice for the management there.  It was a high school job and it was perfect for a person my age.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
