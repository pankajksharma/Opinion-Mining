</title><pros>Pros – Pro employee values through the company`s guiding principles. Tries to enable decisions at the point of impact, but then allows politics to keep real change from happening.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Consensus management makes decision making very slow and painful.  The Sr Leadership team hesitates to make decisions and as a result has kept the company from meeting its potential.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The owner and current President needs to get out to the various sites and meet with his employees. If he is too shy to lead, he should hire a new President quickly so the company can move forward.</advice-to-management>
