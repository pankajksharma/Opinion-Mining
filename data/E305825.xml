“Good overall company to work for with great benefits”

</title><pros>Pros – Benefits are great, including 401(k) matching, bonuses and yearly reviews. The company does a great job of covering a majority of the health care costs, including some or all of the deductible. Most staff are able to leave on time and there are very few late nights required. The company genuinely cares about their employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Being a small company there is a fair amount of staff that either have their position because they are friends with someone there, or they have been there so long that friendships have developed. This sometimes creates difficulties with issue resolution and follow through from management. Also as a small company career advancement is limited.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't forget to look to your staff for the solution to problems. Often it's your staff that are "in the trenches" that know exactly what the problem is and have good suggestions on how to fix it.</advice-to-management>
