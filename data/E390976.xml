“Not great and not so bad to work in CADS”

</title><pros>Pros – If you starting your career in RC Detailing then CADS is the place where you can learn. CADS is especially for starters.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Mainly working hours, you have to work for around 12 hours a day to finish your task. If you are already experienced and over 30 years of age, it will be tough for you to work in CADS.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Respect your workers and recognize their commitment. Encourage those who are working hard and pay them well instead of recruiting from outside by paying more to them. Stop the outflow of workers first. Which by all means should be your priority. There is a double standard exists between rebar and development. For eg.  If workers from development come on Saturday for work they provide biriyani on that day for everyone and if they don't come it will be an very ordinary lunch for rebar workers.</advice-to-management>
