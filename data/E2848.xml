“Great company but slow growth”

</title><pros>Pros – Great company to work for if you like to be on your feet and meeting new people. Discount and other perks are great.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Working holidays and retail hours can be tiring at times. It's hard to move up the ranks fast. Have to be well liked to even be considered. Not about just getting the job done but looking good doing it and being popular amongst the staff.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't be so secretive about everything. It makes the staff feel uncomfortable. Appreciate the staff once in a while instead of just taking the store director in the office and talking for hours. Be on the sales floor and see what the staff is doing and how it feels.</advice-to-management>

“Satisfactory”

</title><pros>Pros – The managers teach you excellent customer service. The orientation is very thorough and detail oriented. For the most part, everyone is friendly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you don't dress the part down to a T, then you probably won't last long, even if you are a hard worker. I couldn't afford to buy anything from the store, even with my employee discount. I worked there for 2 months, but they didn't keep me on. There was an employee who had only been there for a week and they chose her over me. If you want to stay on, make sure you can afford to dress the part and take the initiative to learn how to operate the cash register.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – - The company invests in its employees- Understands that sales people are brand representatives and therefore treat them well.</pros>
<cons>Cons – - The company is so big that different stores can have different atmospheres and can be managed a bit differently.- I worked in two stores and I was not treated very well in one of them.</cons>

“Lowest paid for High End Brand”

</title><pros>Pros – J. Crew Management obviously knows how to pick the right people to work for them.  The employees are exceptionally wonderful to work with.  Everyone is friendly, helpful and there is a great sense of team work.  Employees are cross trained in everything, stock, cashier, sales and cleaning the store.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Way underpaid.  This is the first high end brand I've worked for that paid $8.50 an hour.  Discounts are ok, but if you are only scheduled less than twenty hours a week, it doesn't help to buy anything because you're not getting nearly enough.</cons>

“Great company, great people!”

</title><pros>Pros – Open talk policy- simple to get in touch with upper management and they always respond. In fact, they're always personable. Over time, I built many professional relationships with my regionals, vice president, district manager and co-managers within my district. I loved my district manager and regional as well as my merchant manager.Great pay and PTO- (Paid Time Off) Full time exempt employees start with 20 days and with seniority bumps up to 25. Great benefits and discounts on awesome clothing. This is definitely a career oriented company (for most people). Flexible schedule most of the time, each store has sufficient managers so you can easily take time off, change your work schedule. You are mandated to work only 40/hours a week.Simple policies/procedures and good corporate structure- Simple yet challenging work environment- perfect for people and self development. Anything you do know or need to know, they give you all resources to find it out. This is a strong company and many opportunities are available.I love this company! It isn't for everyone but if you can find your place, it's a mutual love!</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company is growing and expanding so things are a little chaotic at times and the workload can be a little overwhelming. You just have to take some weeks day by day (sometimes hour by hour) and prioritize!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Turnover. Turnover. Turnover. I get it! The retail industry is changing but it's part of our job to build a rock solid team to grow the business. You are supposed to grow your team through people and self development. This is our job as business leaders! I know this isn't a career choice for very part timer but if morale is up- business is up as well! I started in a store where every manager was ten or more years senior and we made bonus almost every month, the workload diminished  their quality of life and they left. This also occurred in every store within my district within two years. QUALITY OF LIFE.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Merchandise, employees, constant new stylish merchandise. Really did enjoy this job, great place to work and fantastic atmosphere.</pros>

“Decent pay, good place to work...”

</title><pros>Pros – The employee discount was great.  It was a fun place to work, depending on who the store manager was.  The pay was really good when I started.  I believe that, since that time, they've lowered the pay.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you had a bad store manager, it literally affected the entire store.  I didn't enjoy having to tell people when I was leaving the floor to go to the restroom.  It felt a little like elementary school.</cons>

“Much better job than my last one.”

</title><pros>Pros – * Good work environment.* The pay is actually pretty good.* Opportunities to grow within the business.</pros>
<cons>Cons – * Sometimes if you don't ask questions (if you want to grow) you won't be taught. If you want it, go get it.* If you are not a well rounded employee, i.e. cashier, stock, merch, support, you will not get hours and make sure your availability is as open as possible.</cons>

“Fair to partly cloudy”

</title><pros>Pros – Standards, quality of product, expectations, opportunities</pros>
<cons>Cons – Completely depends on the dynamics of store director and associate managers. It has all the potential pitfalls and disadvantages of any retail job, unfortunately. Despite being optimistic it does not set itself apart. Don't expect emotional intelligence. Kind of funny how one manager thinks you're great and another has a problem with everything you do. That is a sign of a bad manager, but an especially unprofessional manager when they bad mouth you to others.</cons>

“Good discounts, horrible hours.”

</title><pros>Pros – I loved the discounts. That was the only reason why I loved working there. Cute but expensive clothes. I believe it was 30% discount on top of the current promo they're offering. You get paid every Friday so you don't have to wait two weeks for your paycheck to come.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hours fluctuate every week, there was never set hours. A lot of on calls, I always had around 3 on calls. It was hard to plan my day because of it.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Instead of hiring more people, give your current employees more hours instead.</advice-to-management>

“Greatest company I've ever worked for.”

</title><pros>Pros – 2 weeks vacation, discount is amazing, fun to install creatives, decent pay for college workers, great retail experience, tons of room for evolution in the company, successful retailer, great co-workers, amazingly talented management</pros>
<cons>Cons – People in corporate really don't care about who you are, or what your name is, regardless of the amount of times you may meet then/work along side them. In which case, it is really difficult to move up to corporate as a merchandiser.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Corporate really needs to take the time to acknowledge the hard working visual's in the company, because they are the ones portraying the image of the company to the customer's eye first hand. Who wants to work for a company whose corporate workers don't respect them?</advice-to-management>

“My Management Team was horrible”

</title><pros>Pros – Great pay! Pretty flexible with the hours, Very adorable clothes :) Breaks are reasonable.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Dress code is ridiculously expensive to follow! You dont have to wear their clothes but to keep up with thier dress code that changes every three months is really hard.  You get No Benifits they keep all employees at part time!! They dropped me from 40+ hours a week to 10hours a week without any notice. My Management was horrible None of my managers were on the same page They had me  doing 6 different things in 6 complete different areas!!!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Make sure you take the time to meet with you other managers and key holders before making decisions because store 138 you were a mess!! Don't start employees with 40+ Hours with no benefits then drop them to 10 hours a week.</advice-to-management>

“No training, rude and malicious environment”

</title><pros>Pros – Great for those straight out of college. This was an easier opportunity to get your foot in the door in fashion/retail. I'd recommend a young, fresh grad to take a job here, work for a year, and use it as a stepping stone to your next position.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I can't explain enough how negative my time working here was. I worked in the corporate office and there was high employee turnover, which speaks for itself. Management had little care for employees, and employees were downright malicious to each other. Terrible culture.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – 1. Care more about your employees. Get to know them! And make a time investment in them. Many people could use positive mentorship.2. Create a cross-functional culture committees. There is no sense of "togetherness" at this company. In fact, people are out to get each other, often being immature. Management sorely needs to step up to the plate and stamp out the poor attitudes.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – I've heard they do not pay well. You must be willing to work in a warehouse environment. They have 2 shifts, 1st is from 7-3 and 2nd is from 3:30-11:30. They did not communicate that we would have mandatory overtime as often as we did very well when I accepted the position.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – great discount, cute clothes, good way to build your wardrobe</pros>
<cons>Cons – unprofessional and condescending managementAs a college student when coming home for the holidays I was hoping to pick up a seasonal job to get some spending money. After being hired at J. Crew for seasonal sales I was optimistic about potentially being hired on after the holidays. I only lasted two weeks before giving my notice to the company. Myself and the other seasonal workers were not trained AT ALL on the floor or to use registers/phones,etc. They chose to spend our precious training time by educating us on the company history. Understandable for normal new hires, but not for seasonal work.Management proved to be unhelpful. Scolded employees on the floor in front of fellow associates AND customers. Gets annoyed if you ask questions, etc. Extremely unprofessional management. I would NEVER work here again.</cons>

J.Crew has been a great brand to work for and I would love to continue working here part-time if I didn't land a full-time job elsewhere. You learn the ins and outs of the retail and a chic fashion retailer. Good about giving raises after certain time period.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not really many negatives to talk about. Some upper management can be stiff and strict but that all depends on the individual store.</cons>

“It was ok- low pay but you end up with an awesome wardrobe”

</title><pros>Pros – You get awesome discounts on high quality clothing! You get base salary plus commission!</pros>
<cons>Cons – You get awesome discounts on high quality clothing so you end up spending half your paycheck on it. Commission is actually 0.5%, so lets say you have a good shift and sell 2000 bucks in 4 hours (which almost never happens), only ten would go to you. Minus tax you end up with around 8.</cons>

“Not many hours, on-call shifts...”

</title><pros>Pros – Environment, all about the customer, friendly co-workers</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low hours, not-so-great management, ON-CALL shifts, schedule, low commission</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Instead of the employee having to call in two hours before their shift to see if they need you, they should call you. My store is small, I must admit, but a 4 hour week with 1 associate working with a manager is really tough and lack-of-motivation inspiring.  Yeah, sales will look good on the individual- but the store won't look nice because you're too busy selling hence the low amount of employees working.The managers and co-workers are really nice.  I have a pleasure working with everyone.  Although there are still people I've barely worked with and I've been with the company for 10 months.Also, my store has gone through 5 managers the past 8 months. It's been hectic.There should be away to obtain your work schedule online instead of having to go into the store to get it.  They won't even give it to you over phone unless it's completely necessary.Discount is nice, but I never get to use it because I don't make enough money from the job to be able to spend it on.I did get a raise, which was nice. It was low, but it's the thought that counts.If you want to work here, do not depend on this to be your only job. You'll be grateful if you get a 10 hour week.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Amazing employee discount, enjoyable store atmosphere, the best client base.</pros>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Manage according to the needs of your store. Cities with low salary demographics require extra efforts such as elevated customer service as opposed to cities where J.Crew is so well known that it sells itself.

</title><pros>Pros – The pay is great, as a sales associate you get an hourly plus commission. You also get an amazing discount and when I mean amazing I mean AMAZING. You get 60% off new items, 50% off sales and somewhere below for the rest. Most employees are very friendly and the clothing is beautiful.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They are not flexible with hours. As a student it is hard to have this job if you are doing anything else. They expect you to work 30 hrs a week and rarely let me off when I requested. I once asked for a vacation 4 months in advance and I did not get all 3 days off. That's an easy request and they were not helpful. Honestly there is a rank for who gets off and who doesn't, they should hire more employees in order to avoid this issue. Its sad because I loved the brand and the people but as a part time associate the scheduling just isn't reasonable with this company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>

“One of the hottest retailers to be working for at the moment”

</title><pros>Pros – Fast-paced environment that allows you to meet and help a variety of different personalities. Management really emphasizes that we all work together as a team and communicate effectively, which makes everything run pretty smoothly, even during holiday. I was able to move from support to associate within 6 months, which was a great way to go. Knowing how the back/stock and register end works has really helped me as a seller. I have one of the greatest management teams, and they've been extremely accommodating with my college class schedule.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The holiday season can be really, really tough to get through. I worked the four days before and two days after Christmas without a break, and it was pretty brutal. And immediately after holiday, hours drop off almost completely, which I didn't mind with my homework, but it really hurt some of the other employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It's amazing how smooth everything has been running thus far! Keep doing what you're doing, but make sure to keep an eye on support and sellers, because they're the absolute backbone of a store. In the grand scheme of things, we're seen as slaves, but it's better than most retailers ever treat their employees</advice-to-management>

“Fun job with great training, although low pay”

</title><pros>Pros – They really have implemented an amazing 'sales associate' training program. I had worked in sales before, but after 15-20 hours of paid training, you gain a deep understanding of the product you're selling, and a number of extremely transferable sales skills. The company also clearly wants frequent feedback from the employees, and the managers at the store I worked at definitely had my back. I felt valued as an employee.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Pays not great. Otherwise pretty good work environment. I only left because I was going back to school.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – J Crew spends a lot of time training you on their suppliers, types of fabric, fit, etc. even if you're just seasonal. This type of attention to every employee really characterizes the work environment in a lot of ways. Great discount. Good hourly pay.</pros>

“A Good Place to Grow”

</title><pros>Pros – J. Crew is a culture and the goal is to make shopping an experience. you learn how to deal with a breadth of customers, managers and co-workers and leave with a greater respect for jobs in the service industry. Customer service is paramount!</pros>
<cons>Cons – I wanted the opportunity to climb the ladder a little faster. Be patient, if you really want it, it will come. Put in some months as an associate, wow them with your sales and hopefully move to a personal shopper or mid-level manager.</cons>

“Simply put, there is no other employer I would rather work for.”

</title><pros>Pros – The training program is very involved. Any confident person who goes through the program will be very pleased and feel very empowered. J. Crew gives the employee a lot of autonomy in regards to customer service and there is a sense that "the store is your kingdom." The management is always eager for feedback, positive or negative and very frequently acts on that feedback.Performance based pay is also very nice.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The only negative is the strict visual requirements the stores must maintain. This removes much of the creative process from the employee and results is a workplace that tends to become "stale" from a visual standpoint.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Best advice I could offer is to expand the Blue Martini/iPad aspect of training. It has a cumbersome interface and sales opportunities are lost because some employees just do not know how to use it very well. Also, stores in high wealth markets may benefit from suiting.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Discount was incredible, company was very well organized and training was really great when it came to knowing the company. I had great relationships with my managers, and actually enjoyed working holiday season with them! They made sure to include incentives for us to sell more with commission, or little door prizes. It's a brand that people trust, and we were able to trust it as well.</pros>

“Fun, but management could use help”

</title><pros>Pros – Fun environment, not stressful, great discount... 30% off regular price, 50% off sale items and 60% off select items.Part time employees are eligible for health insurance, as low as $9 a week.And you get paid every week.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Sometimes JCrew customers have unreasonable expectations and we have to acquiesce regardless. The pay is low and you end up spending your check on their clothes because of the great discount.The commission is only .5% and if you don't make a certain amount of sales (selling cost) they will cut your pay.  The personal shoppers cut in on your customers and take your sales, so it's hard to make your "selling cost".</cons>

“J. Crew Sales Associate”

</title><pros>Pros – The work environment was great and the people were so friendly. I liked all of my managers and they were very good in training me. I did have retail experience already when working there though.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As a sales associate, you really don't get more than ten hours a week. The only people that get full time hours are the managers and personal shoppers. This is nice if you are working there while you are going to school, or as a second job to supplement income, but it was my job for the summer, and I was always begging people to send unwanted hours my way.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – The comany itself is a very good place to work for, and the discount is great. I like that for a retail job they work with you pretty well when you need time off or a schedule change. Everyone is very nice I like all of my co-workers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It all depends on who your managers are whether you'll enjoy it or not. I think it's pretty easy to advance to different positions but at some places it depends on who you are not necessarily what you can do or have done.</cons>

“Great Company, Awful HR Department”

</title><pros>Pros – J.Crew is a great company to work for but their human resources department is completely incompetent. They are slow, rude and often confused. It seems as if they do not want to be working in HR and would rather be working in another department within the company which as you can imagine means they don't do their job very well. I received an offer but was more than disappointed in the way they handled things over a 4 week interview process.</pros>

</title><pros>Pros – Pay scales with tenure and sales (partially commission based). A good seller will make more and will progress through the company faster.</pros>

“Positive when the Management was positive.”

</title><pros>Pros – Great corporate discounts, it started out as a fun friendly lively place to work, but as the company went public, the quality of their goods dropped, and the standards of their management took a dive as well.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Regional team management 'played favourites.'  No scope for corporate mobility or advancing careers within the company.  I worked with the company throughout my college education and repeatedly inquired about internships and higher level positions to no avail.</cons>

“This was a good retail experience, I learned a lot, and took full advantage of the sizable discount offered.”

</title><pros>Pros – The people that I worked with were professional but also fun and easy going. I got the opportunity to work overnights to make window displays. Management consistently arranged sales contests for us so that things would stay interesting.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I was disappointed in how much emphasis was put on selling the jcrew credit card. Employees are not allowed to have one, it is not a particularly good deal in my opinion for customers, and management expects you to "overcome objections" when people don't want to open one.</cons>

“Overall Pretty Good Place to Work”

</title><pros>Pros – The pros I would say are the extremely flexible hours and management is very flexible... I sometimes wonder if management is too leaniate sometimes.  The employee discount is excellent, and it is a fun working environment.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The cons would be that the pay is poor.  I am considered a "sales support" associate, so I have one base hourly pay and do not receive commission.  The personal shoppers or recently changed to "very personal stylists" are sometimes held on a pedestal.</cons>

“Would've liked to continue to work here but.....”

</title><pros>Pros – Personally like the brand and really impressed with how Mickey has raised J. Crew and Madewell to the level it is now. He's smart and has great vision for the company. Would have been nice to be able to work more directly with him. Could probably learn a lot from him.Great discountsCo-workers were ok, some nice....3 weeks vacation & Summer hours (though rarely take advantage due to work load)</pros>
<cons>Cons – There's not much work life balance for the lower level positions.....understandable in some respects (entry-level) but many times, too ridiculous with the amount of grunt work. They just pile it on....seems sometimes just for their own fun.There was one senior manager who was not very professional. Most of the time sitting around gossiping with the girls, whether it was about other co-workers or celebrities or did not talk to you or greet you at all if you were outside his small clique. Definitely showed favoritism, complained and whined often.  Did not act like a senior manager at all. Hard to have any respect for him. He seemed to promote favoritism, his directs also had their favorites. My manager and associate mgr although nice, were very close and working under them was uncomfortable at times because of this.Almost everyone looks and dresses the same (maybe with exception of the designers - who have some uniqueness). 80% of the people are quite young and look like a J. Crew/Madewell catalog model.  It's almost cult-like. You definitely need to drink the Kool-Aid to work there.They need managers who are trained to be managers, not young girls trying to be managers or tenured unskilled senior managers to handle conflict among co-workers. There were instances where 2 girls had a disagreement and loud enough for all to hear.  But since the managers are not trained to handle situations such as these, instead, there is cattiness and favoritism. It was unpleasant to hear.  Too bad Mickey never gets to witness these despite his frequent visits around the office floors.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't continue to retain certain senior managers just because they've been working there 15-20 years and dress in J. Crew head to toe.  If they are not professional and productive, not sure that their loyalty is worth keeping, especially if they are not helpful to those he manages or the company.Don't be afraid to hire people who have some uniqueness and do not dress exactly like a J.Crew/Madewell catalog models. Definitely need some diversity in the company - different races, styles, age group, etc..... Yes, there are the token representatives (diverse) but definitely not enough, especially in their merchandising departments.Maybe once Mickey gets the company at a certain level, he can then concentrate on hiring more diverse and professional employees.</advice-to-management>

“Fun people, but micromanaging management, and not enough money.”

</title><pros>Pros – Most of the people drawn to J.Crew are really fun and intelligent, so working with them is great.  It's a good environment.  They offer health benefits for part time employees, which is a wonderful thing that all companies should do.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is so little you can't support yourself with just a sales associate or cashier position.  More than anything, there are always too few hours to go around to make a living, but you are constantly on call for them because they don't keep regular schedules, so you give your life's availability to them for around $600 a month.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It's hard to say anything to the store management because their hands are tied by the corporate requirements, but in general, I would say take it easy on your employees regarding corporate policies and nit-picky dress code requirements.</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Upper management should be more attuned to their employees to earn their respect. It makes for a better work environment.

</title><pros>Pros – Okay. So the only reason there are 4 stars is because of the associate discount. IT IS CRAZY GOOD. Also, this would be the only reason I would ever go back to this company to work with as well. 0.5% Commission usually makes up for the taxes that deduct from your paycheck.</pros>
<cons>Cons – These TERRIBLE things called on calls, where you are technically not scheduled but must have that time open anyways in case they need you and tell you to come to work. YOU have to call to check if they need you or not 2 hours before your scheduled on call. Also, SNOBBY, STUCK UP management. Like really, you manage at a retail clothing store.. get your head out of your butt please. your not that important.  When you are shopping in your own time they do NOTHING for you act as if you don't exist. Making goal doesnt mean you are a good associate...management has to like you in order to be an outstanding associate and get more hours.</cons>

“Always interesting and exciting”

</title><pros>Pros – Most employees are satisfied with their jobs - scheduling, pay and benefits are appropriate. Very fun environment to work in.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As a sales associate the pay is not enough to live comfortably in New York City.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Offer information to employees about the product that is not available to customers through the catalog. A booklet with information including care instructions, intended fit, what happens after washing garments, etc. Customers trust a knowledgeable sales associate and not every associate can afford to own all of the clothes (which is currently the only way available for employees to have full product knowledge).</advice-to-management>

“Uncomfortable”

</title><pros>Pros – Great benefits in regards to PTO days and health benefits. The ability to meet some great people and make some new friends.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This box cannot contain all the cons to working for JCrew.  I am aware that call centers can have cliques and friends but this is ridiculous.  Jobs not being posted and given to upper managements friends. special treatment for those that hang out and drink with the managers.  Working hard is not appreciated, and is often taken advantage of in this company.  There are double standards for associates and leadership, I have seen some people get fired for the smallest infraction, and some people have been given several chances.  Their is no leadership development in place which often leads to the company losing good associates to other companies.  Probably 75% of the employees are looking for other employment.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There needs to be an over haul of management, there are some in those positions that have no people skills or leadership skills. There are some that are excellent, however they are overlooked because they do not conform to the norm.  Mickey you need to make some surprise visits so that the associates are not "coached" on what to and what not to say to you, so you could get the truth.    That is if you want to know the truth.</advice-to-management>

“My experience with the new J. Crew outlet store in OpryMills Mall is horrible!”

</title><pros>Pros – The only positive thing that I may say about J. Crew, is the fact the associates get an amazing discount. The job is very, very easy.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Here is the downside about working for J. Crew. The pay is HORRIBLE!!! We as associates are barely making ends meet. The DM has changed their mind about giving fulltime to assoicates, even though we are still working fulltime hours. The level of respect from management to the associates, is down right rude, condensending and unfair. We are all grown ups that work in the store, but we are snooped upon and spoken to like we are children. We are made to feel very dumb and plain stupid. We as associates in this store, find the upper management to be very, very snobby and ill mannered. I have worked in retail for 17 years, and this job ranks as one of the worst jobs I have had. We work so hard in that store and we get the J. Crew cards and we are never given thanks. We worked over nights last week for the CEO to show up. He showed up alright, just not in our store. We were the last on his list and he had to catch his personal jet back home to NY. Talk about a major let down"(</cons>

“Good for Professional Experience, Bad for Saving Money or Having an Active Social Life”

</title><pros>Pros – Fun atmosphere, good (or decent) discount on clothes, excellent if you are looking to work in a professional, fast-paced environment, empowerment in regards to customer service & assistance in certain situations, company growth brings some excitement to the product</pros>
<cons>Cons – Poorly scheduled hours, lack of communication from management at times in regards to changes in policy & inventory, shortage of salespeople and/or cashiers at crucial peak hours (due to poor scheduling & foresight), high pressure on sales staff (and cashiers, even) to meet daily goals that are at times unrealistic, very demanding schedule during holidays & peak weekends with a shortage of regular hours due to "On Calls", fair amount of pressure to purchase clothes from week to week, work is at times shrugged off by both full-time sales staff & management with no consideration to sales support or cash wrap staff, pay is par for the course (slightly over minimum wage), at times there is no chance/moment to pause to catch your breath or to grab a drink of water (as the level of activity & traffic in the store tends to be somewhat overwhelming during peak hours)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – COMMUNICATION: Sometimes, it's all you talk about! (other than Goals).  Follow that advice and ask your SUPPORT staff for key ideas on how to improve the efficiency of the store, inventory system, etc. They, along with your beloved salespersons, are the reasons for the company's success. Recognize their potential & don't use them up only to discard like tissues. The amount of respect & friendly concern you give to your customers should always measure up to how you treat your amazing employees, the ones who not only find what a customer walked in for that day & possibly more but also make the store look neat & up to standard each closing. So pay. it. forward.</advice-to-management>

“distinctive”

</title><pros>Pros – Working at J.Crew has its own unique way to show you retailing. They give you a strong sense of a company is willing to strive for the best. The are willing to find new ideas and always looking for modernism however they always know their target market. And you get a great employee discount!!!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Working retail in general has its general cons of not being very glamorous.That same goes for J.Crew not the best hours and breaking for 15minutes gives you no time to do anything and being in one store gets boring but that is most retail positions.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management needs to be more open to learning who there employee are. Learning what there goals are or where they strive to be with a company will help with better positions because not everyone works great in sales or certain sections of a store.</advice-to-management>

“Typical retail work in a really weird location”

</title><pros>Pros – Some of the best reasons for working at J.Crew are the discount you get on the clothing, the pay is decent, and everyone is relatively friendly and easy to get along with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Retail can be a very political game. Sometimes the management choices were ones a lot of the workers did not agree with but somehow went through. Managers with little to no education on human resource management or management tactics.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – People do not want to work somewhere that they cannot grow. After working at this location on and off for around two years I was never offered a raise or a promotion within the company. This seems a bit weird to me.</advice-to-management>

“J.Crew is a great place to expand ones product knowledge and to gain experience in the retail field.”

</title><pros>Pros – Your co-workers are generally friendly.  Most are very down-to-earth and understand that everyone is working towards a common goal.  If you work at a larger store, getting the time off that you need can be quite easy.  The managerial staff is generally quite knowledgeable and willing to explain.  Some of the personal shoppers are completely consumed with the world of J.Crew, this is rather refreshing and provides a positive working environment.  If you're working full time at J.Crew, the benefits can be quite helpful - full time employees receive on average 20 payed days off a year and health/dental care plans are offered at a discounted price.  Finally, the associate discount might just be the biggest plus.  Employees receive 30% off regularly priced items, 50% off sale item, 5 wear-to-work items a month at 50% off, and there is also "The 60's List" - a list with various items (both in store and online at 60-75% off).</pros>
<cons>Cons – Competition when selling is never a fun thing.  Some of the associates are very serious about their daily goals and will stop at nothing to get there.  I, personally have never been involved in an elevated situation selling-wise, but I have definitely witnessed many.  The dress code can be quite ridiculous. Employees are required to wear a "third piece" when wearing jeans. This "third piece" is a jacket or cardigan.  This can be a nuisance while working in the southern California area (yes, the weather is usually nice, but we all have those days...). The store can get very hot and forcing employees to wear layer upon layer of clothing is borderline cruel.  Another downside is the scheduling. If you work at a small J.Crew location it can be virtually impossible to get a shift covered.  I've also encountered some favoritism at my J.Crew.  The managers tend to become close with the personal shoppers, you can't blame them, they are both full time positions and therefore spend a lot of time together by default.  The only bothersome thing about this is favoritism when faced with making the schedule.  Personal shoppers, or just well-liked employees, will receive prime selling shifts while everyone else is left with closing shifts.  Finally, the commission system is not all it's cracked up to be.  Unless you are selling MASSIVE amounts of product per day, you won't see much difference at all in your weekly paycheck.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The managers at J.Crew are all quite experienced in the retail field.  In my almost five year employment period at J.Crew, I have never met a manager that I haven't liked.  Managers are extremely well-versed on product, conduct and procedures.  The only advice that I could offer would to be a little more understanding when it comes to selling.  To compare a part time sales associates to a full time Personal Shopper is unreasonable and unfair.  The associates, most of them any way, try very hard to make their goals and sell the product that they themselves truly love - please try and give them the benefit of the doubt.</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Wish that management was more organized and hire managers, store directors from within the company rather than from other random stores, etc. As well as training needs a major improvement.</advice-to-management>

“Great Discount, Bad Hours”

</title><pros>Pros – The atmosphere was great and everyone had a really good attitude.  Compared to what I've heard about their other stores, we had little competition between associates for customers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They give you odd hours, and not many of them at that.  On top of that, its hard to work in additional jobs because of the hours.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – More consistency in the scheduling.  Also, it would be nice if the managers in the stores knew of ways that employees could bridge over to the corporate side.  It seemed like the in-store managers didn't know much about this</advice-to-management>

“Fine for a part time job, but full time is a trap”

</title><pros>Pros – Great clothes, very competent and professional leadership, being part of a company that feels like it is experiencing solid growth. Their style is constantly being refined and evolving. The products are made of such high-quality fabrics (most of the time) that you can feel proud to represent these goods. J. Crew is most definitely the best ready to wear brand in its price category, and it is clear that other fashion retailers try to emulate its brand identity.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I think it is possible for the shining stars to be recognized by the company and promoted (I am familiar with at least one case of an employee being promoted to Somerset), but overall being at the Ann Arbor store feels like being on the far side of the earth as far as corporate opportunities are concerned. People have spent years at the company and become managers, but seem like their mission becomes pushing AA sales to the point that the store is allowed to sell more specialty items, like the Somerset store has.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I think the management is doing a great job overall. I know the AA store is doing well. I just think that it is a better choice for someone who is certain they want to settle down in AA.</advice-to-management>

“Meh.”

</title><pros>Pros – Great employee discount, which is nice given all the awesome clothes they have. Co-workers are generally friendly and pretty attractive.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Extreme focus on sales while saying customer service is also important, although customer satisfaction is obviously secondary. Slightly conceited management.</cons>

“Learning Experience”

</title><pros>Pros – J.Crew offers so many benefits and awards emplyees in more ways that I can count. - paid time off, incentives for working extra hours, incentives for receiving 100% on audits, etc. Most managment takes time to sit and go over job performance and audits to offere ways to improve. There are always job postings for opportunities to be promoted.</pros>
<cons>Cons – To be employed  at the call center - you must work at least one weedend day (ie saturday or sunday) this takes a lot of time away from family. Also, the only day J.Crew call center is closed is on Christmas Day - if you don't get  approved time off for Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve or  another religious holiday you have to work or take a write up. J.Crew just assumes people don't travel during the holiday and certainly are not understanding during the season. JCrew is not lenient for  extended sick days- i was close to being fired because I was very sick. I brought in12 doctors notes ranging from my dr to gastroenterologists about having tests & needing time off for being sick and I was still written up - HR and management wouldn't budge.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Akot of favortism and "cliques", if you don't fit into a certain "criteria' a certain "look" you are not appreciated or promoted.  If you have any feedback it is not received well.  Some associates are praised for everything they do and some never receive any feedback unless it is negative.  Discipline is not consistent, some associates are given chance after chance, and some are not.  A work ethic is not appreciated,you cannot be individual, you have to conform to the company.</cons>

“Management style changes across the board mean a disappointing future for employees”

</title><pros>Pros – Information sharing as far as sales goals, projections, and earnings. Discounts are reasonable, especially on sale items ( 50% off).</pros>
<cons>Cons – When I started at J.Crew there was an "across the board" management re-structuring. It became far less personal between Employer-Employee, meaning less flexibility on hours, and days availability. The professionalism and competency of management was laughable, even at the flagship Manhattan store that I was working for. Overnight floor sets, inventory, and re-stocking became nearly impossible.</cons>

“Great corporation to work. Great teams and talent.”

</title><pros>Pros – Some extremely talented people work here... each and every person's voice can be heard - whether by your supervisor or by Mickey Drexler. Each person can make a difference and the people who make a difference are recognized and applauded. Great team and group of people. Of course every day is not perfect but it is what you make of it. People are supported... not cut throat like at other fashion companies.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some people in top positions are pretty clueless... it is difficult for their supervisors or for Mickey to know the truth about them. Eventually the worst ones are usually found out and end up leaving. But they held alot of people and the company back.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more in touch with what is really going on. People will be afraid to say bad things about their supervisors who aren't doing a good job. It is up to you to find out the truth.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – The discount.  That is it. There is really nothing positive about this location, I would not tell anyone to work here, it is really a miserable place to work, there are much better part time jobs out there.</pros>
<cons>Cons – EVERYTHING. The managers are less than satisfactory, the good ones always leave or get moved to a different store and then we are still stuck with the managers that are constantly yelling at us or having talks with us in the office over things that they should just let go of.  Some of us have been with the company for many years but are treated like we are brand new, and the high rate of turnover is unstable for the employees.  The customers do not like this location because of management issues and all of my coworkers hate it because of management.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Great discount on clothing, customers are generally really nice.  The customer service training is excellent, and the company does a great job of communicating exactly what it wants from its employees. The product is of good quality, which makes it easy to sell.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hours are really inconsistent both in terms of schedule and in the amount you get per week.  Rather than distribute by seniority or performance, they are sort of given at random.  There is little communication from management in terms of when hours should increase, or how long slow periods will last.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management has gotten much better after they instituted a new performance review format, as it really clarifies a lot of things that the company is looking for.  The local store director is a little petty, unfortunately, when it comes to giving employees hours and recognition, but hopefully the new policy will help.</advice-to-management>

“J. Crew”

</title><pros>Pros – For fashion retail, J. Crew has to rank among the best places to work, they offer better pay than most comparable stores, an exceptional employee discount program and oftentimes a strong built-in clientele base that you can focus on building positive customer relationships with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The corporate numbers game of collecting phone numbers, e-mail addresses and even more extensive customer information can rapidly backfire. Sure, nearly every store is doing it these days, but unfortunately, the reality of the matter is that as often as you have a great experience with a customer, you're far more likely to take a good customer experience and turn it sour when you begin pressing for more information. If the focus was more on quality as opposed to quantity, I believe that over time you would create far more "great" customer experiences that turn into legitimate contacts.</cons>

With some customers you build that trust on the first experience. With others, it takes a few visits to gain their trust enough for them to actually become a true "client." There needs to be more room allowed for sales associates to feel that out as opposed to being pressured by management to collect more information.</advice-to-management>

“The concept of "On Call" shifts is akin to indentured slave labor”

</title><pros>Pros – - If you are subsidized by your parents and only want great discounts on clothes - in other words, you really don't need a job but want to look good - this is the place for you.- Great clothing discounts - if you must have the clothes</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Too many "on call" shifts .... To be "on call" for three or four shifts a week, while at the same time being scheduled for only four actual hours of work, reflects an insidious lack of respect for employees. This alarming trend in retail – and particularly with J. Crew –  is indicative of an economic volatility that has rendered jobs a scarce commodity. Employers now feel that they can treat employees as indentured slaves.- "Personal shoppers" are aloof, nasty, and uncommunicative. Most are poised at the fitting rooms to pounce on potential customers which in turn, creates a lot of tension on the sales floor among sales associates.- Stores have their own little clicks of workers - similar to a frat house mentality - if you don't immediately fit in, you never will. If these same people are in league with management, you may very well be doomed to "on call" shifts for perpetuity.</cons>

“J Crew Factory”

</title><pros>Pros – Supportive team of managers.  Good discount, if the clothes are your style.  A very busy store= a decent amount of part time hours if you are a hard worker.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As an associate, the sales we have in the store sometimes make it difficult to reach daily goals on a slow day.  They are, however, great for the customers and most often the reason they came to the store in the first place.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I think the store should begin to do "fit sessions" again.  As someone who doesn't typically wear the clothes, I am always unsure of how things fit, unless I've seen a piece on a lot of different customers.  I know the responsible thing to do as an associate would be to try things on myself without having an official fit session, but at the end of the day, it's the last thing I would want to be doing.</advice-to-management>

“Great Place for Students”

</title><pros>Pros – -Competitive pay and commission-Excellent discounts-Great recognition for high-performing employees-Decent training for new employees-Management is usually very helpful, respectful, and knowledgeable</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Commission breeds competitiveness (while not necessarily a bad thing, it can cause tension between associates)-Minimal hours for part-time associates (on average, 8 hours a week or 2 shifts)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Personal shoppers, while a great service to the customer, sometimes heeds the performance of a sales associate. It is hard to work with customers while a personal shopper is on duty, because the personal shopper tends to take on as many customers as he/she can to make her sales quota (which is greater than the associate's). Senior management needs to find a way to strike some balance.</advice-to-management>

Excellent reputationI enjoyed the people I worked with, they became family/friends in many ways.Management was very reasonable with time off, and giving the necessary support you needed as an associate and a person.Product knowledge and information widely available.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Quality of clothing does not match price. As an associate this became difficult to sell that "j.crew quality."Upper management was not at flexible or understanding. Did not take the time to get to know each store more personally. VERY "Corporate"-- There is always someone you have to answer to.Corporate and Upper management could use to learn about servant leadership. It is not hard to get easily burnt out, because at the end of the day its only about profits.Very Bitter-Sweet experience.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – They have outstanding benefits.  5 weeks vacation to start and the CEO gives out 3 or 4 days off at random.  They have Summer Fridays too.  The staff is very talented and most of them agreeable to work with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The organization is non-existent.  There is no clear chain of command and so much overlap between groups that most people aren't 100% sure who manages what group.  The org chart looks like a connect the dots gone horribly wrong.  There are a lot of strong personalities there and it's difficult to navigate the political waters.

“Great Quality and Clothing! Not Great Quality in Management”

</title><pros>Pros – - the discount is amazing.- the quality and style of J Crew is tops.- co workers are great and make working at J Crew fun.- it is a relaxed working atmosphere</pros>
<cons>Cons – - the same management type is at every store. Management whom are overworked and to busy to give feedback and trainging to their employees because their main focus is to get ahead in the company or make their bonuses.- Management who are not trained properly themselves. They have no clue what HR is! No support from the Management for movement or wage increases.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – - Please begin a comprehensive training for Management. If you have such a program it is not shown with the management I have worked with.- Please begin to hire management who have ethics and morals not just a dedication to J Crew with power mongering intentions.- Allow your managers to be able to treat their store as their own business. This will better fit the dempgraphics of the store and may be able to gain more customers.I will not say if Mickey Drexler is doing a good job or not because, my main focus was management, and that is not where his speciality is. I believe his managers in Personel and HR are where they need to have more innovation. Help the managers stay motivated in their jobs, have monthly training focuses, and most of all make sure that the managers in the stores are reviewing their sales associates work preformance.</advice-to-management>

“Higher end retail will bring a different demographic of customers so be ready for them..”

</title><pros>Pros – Clean, good environment, fair treatment between girls and guys working there, friendly managers, great location. You deal mostly with people who are well off financially, or their children. Keep in mind the types of customers that shop here compared to other retail stores of different styles or lower prices think they are special or expect top customer service because they are higher end shoppers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you're a guy, get ready to try to sell in the womens department, knowing whether something shrinks or folding ladies jeans might make your voice tone raise a little higher and feel like you need a beer asap to go back to being a man.If you like to hear about what girls/some metro guys favorite colors are or omg something is just so so cute, this is the place for you.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Excellent employee discount, friendly atmosphere, very flexible work schedules.  Great place to work if you just need some extra cash or are a student</pros>
<cons>Cons – Good luck getting a raise as a part-time employee, even if you've been there for two years.  And good luck becoming full-time, because they can't pay you, but expect to be asked to work full-time hours as a part-time employee</cons>

<cons>Cons – -Must be able to multitask at all times, which sometimes becomes overwhelming when the store is busy, a lot of people are calling and a new shipment has come in.-Not all associates are motivated, so in many instances you have to do more that what is equitable-Store meetings were always very early into the morning</cons>

“Great discounts and environment”

</title><pros>Pros – Generous employee discounts, previews to upcoming products/marketing schemes, generous 100% discount on a few items to "wear to work" after 60 days of employment, the company prefers to assist customers and make sure they are comfortable, the sales commission is low (5%), the company does not put a high amount of pressure on associates to make a sale, but rather to insure the customer has an enjoyable experience. Sales associates are not expected to be "security" or confront anyone for loss prevention. A manager is always on-site.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The health plan for part-time was cut; almost all of J. Crew's associates are part-time so this impacts a lot of people. Very few stores offer full-time positions. Some stores have outdated computers, which have frequent crashes. Parking is not validated or compensated for workers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please consider adding health benefits for the majority of your work-force in stores: the part-time workers. Have a more structured training module for new hires: in my experience they are taught the basics of the store and thrown into the fray.</advice-to-management>

“Great opportunity for growth if you are a high performer.”

</title><pros>Pros – Management really wants associates to become acclimated with the specific location, and climate of the company. Associates are given a level of training and autonomy rarely seen in retail. Great opportunity to create a client list  and/or experience if one plans on parlaying J.Crew position into a career as a personal shopper at upscale retail establishments.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Commission-based sales can create a highly competitive and at times tense work environment. The clientele is accustomed to a very hands-on, customer-centric shopping experience, and can be quite demanding and rude.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Police commission dishonesty (associates taking credit for sales that are not theirs) more . Find ways to invigorate associates who are low performing rather than saying "sell, and get cards, or you won't get hours."</advice-to-management>

“Visit J. Crew store before applying for a job so that you can get a good feel for the store management and staff.”

</title><pros>Pros – Every store has its own personality.  I was very lucky to work in a very supportive store,where teamwork was paramount,  however, our store management received little, if no support from above.  This made communication of policies and procedures very sporadic and haphazard.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Working "outside of the box" is difficult.  Given the current state of retail, the ability to provide superior customer service can be compromised by lack of staff.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – J. Crew offers an amazing discount.  Better, I believe, than most similar stores.</pros>

“J.Crew Somerset Collection - A Google Place to Work”

</title><pros>Pros – I was in graduate school and worked another job when I worked at the J.Crew Somerset Collection. The managers were flexible with my schedule and never questioned my requests. The staff was helpful and courteous and I made some excellent friends at this store. Employees are rewarded for hard work and goal achievement and I was awarded employee of the week during the 2005 Holiday season. I was given an opportunity to choose any piece off the floor I wanted. All in all, I would recommend J.Crew to anyone interested in the fashion industry. Good products, good people, good company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The downsides of working any retail position are commissions and sales goals. Normally kind and respectful people can become a bit territorial and step on toes in these situations. That part of it is not for me. I am not a confrontational person but occasionally ran into situations where other Client Specialists tried to "steal" my sale or work in my section of the store. I also didn't like that because of this "eagerness" many of the customers could tell it was a commission based job and were defensive when they walked in the door. This situation may deter some people from taking a job like this.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – 20 days off a week for full-time mgmt</pros>
<cons>Cons – total disconnect between corporate and stores, unreasonable expectations as store level in terms of customer service and tasking on given budget and payroll. bad behavior is rewarded again and again...the wrong people continually get promoted within this company and talent is rarely recognized.</cons>

“Associates are the ones who do the sales but they don't see any results or improvements for their selves”

</title><pros>Pros – The discounts. You get 30-70% on clothing and accessories. Also, they are very flexible for the hours you can work each week and you can still get a discount even if you only work a few hours per week or every other week!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Schedules are not structured and even though you may work until closing, sometimes the store is not recovered on time, the markdowns are not finished or there is cleaning to do and associates have to stay till later than 9 in some cases. During the break there are no accommodations for associates ( in the break room) such as enough seating, enough space int he fridge to keep our lunch or dinner and anything to do after those hard working hours with customers. Also, the pay does not compensate all the heavy duty work to be done in the store.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Corporate Jcrew should evaluate HR policies in the Stores and reward and compensate associates more accordingly. Also, there are managers in the Store who do not have a college degree and are not bringing high level input to improve processes as well as leadership and management skills in the store.</advice-to-management>

“An OK Job only to Break Even”

</title><pros>Pros – The discount is the best reason to work, however working in retail is counterproductive if you are trying to actually save money.  Also, the factory store where I worked had amazing sales associates who were helpful, friendly, and had a sense of humor.  The people at that particular location made work enjoyable.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I was dissatisfied with the low entry-level salary.  I excelled as a new employee and felt as though I deserved higher pay based on my educational background and success as a sales associate.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I wish that Senior Management had communicated better.  I won a sales associate challenge, and promised to be awarded a $50 Associate gift card.  Three months passed until I received it, and I only received 4 different J.Crew gift cards worth $10 each.  I was very disappointed with how the Senior Management handled the situation, and felt that I deserved better treatment as both a J.Crew employee and customer.</advice-to-management>

“Good Discounts, Few Downsides”

</title><pros>Pros – J. Crew is one of the few retail chains that prides itself on customer service and actually means it.  Employees are not forced to badger customers and are, in fact, encouraged to simply interact with them like normal people.  The segue into a sale becomes much easier when the customer does not start off his or her shopping experience being annoyed.  J. Crew is well known for very high-quality clothing and is a great place to work when building a wardrobe for the corporate/office world.  The discount is great, and you are NOT required to wear their clothing (a rare find in the retail world).  This is not to say you are not required to project their look; rather, you can wear anything that does not advertise another brand or company.  I met great people working at J. Crew, as well.  Commission for client specialists is great, and commission exists for sales associates (but only on sales greater than a certain amount... I think it was $150, and it's meager)</pros>
<cons>Cons – The on-call shifts are difficult, particularly if you have more than one job and need to have a more definite schedule.  My on-call shifts were used some of the time, and I had them less often as a client specialist than I did as a sales associate, due to the nature of being a client specialist.  It's still a major pain, though.  Wear comfortable shoes because you will be on your feet on a hardwood floor for the bulk of your shift.  I've never been in a J. Crew store anywhere in the country (and I've been to many) that had proper temperature regulation.  You either freeze or you roast, but freezing is far preferable because J. Crew favors the layered look.  People do steal sales, which matters a great deal because your performance rating is based on your sales level.  As a client specialist, I had some great people who would watch out for my sales, but I was in trouble if they weren't working.  When you're a sales associate it doesn't matter as much, but stealing a sale from a client specialist is a big deal because they all work on commission.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Store management always seemed fairly in tune with what was happening with the merchandise in general and with the staff.  The corporate management needed to pay more attention to demand levels -- my store did a lot of catalogue orders (and/or lost a number of sales) because we never had the more specialized items, like cashmere and women's suiting.</advice-to-management>

“satisfied employee”

</title><pros>Pros – J. Crew does an excellent job of listening to their employees and understanding their customers. Unlike, other retail environments, J. Crew allows sales associates to remain human and interact with customers on a one-on-one level, while maintaining a level of professionalism. The environment created by management is one that creates respect within, and begets respect throughout. Employees have a voice, and whether you want to move up, or voice a concern, matters are always taken into consideration. Of course, the discount is more than fair.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Anyone who is not in management is subject to "On-call" shifts. These can be 3 to 8 hour shifts and there is no way to know if you are working or not but a mere 2 hours ahead of time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The company has been around for sometime. Information is available to do thorough research to better gauge an understanding of shopping patterns per store location. Such as different clientele at each location, general traffic, and purchase patterns. This way, management is able to reduce or eliminate many on-call shifts, while still being able to balance payroll at each store.</advice-to-management>

“Um.”

</title><pros>Pros – There were good discounts on their clothes. The people are friendly, and it helps your fashion sense. Every time you come to work, you dress to impress. Every sales associate are suppose to be a model. Since there was no commission, everyone was quite friendly. There wasn't any disputes about sales.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The sales job did not align incentives well because there was no commission. Also there wasn't much to do as an sales associate. Other than bothering customers, folding clothes, and running the dressing rooms, the job is pretty boring. There isn't much the company can do about the situation.</cons>

“Overreaching goals and overly aggressive mgmt”

</title><pros>Pros – -Good discount-Good associates as coworkers-Nice clothes</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management doesn't seem to staff the store properly and there are so little hours to be given and a large staff that needs hours. Mgmt also seems overly aggressive in trying to get their sales associates to make a high volume of sales (which if you don't make, your hours get slashed). The only people who get hours are management and stylists. Hours are far and few between despite having decent sales.</cons>

“Immature and misguided management”

</title><pros>Pros – The best part of working here is the discount. Though you can't make enough money to use it often</pros>
<cons>Cons – The hours are completely ridiculous.On-Call shifts are never used.Management talk about associates on the sales floor.Management treats associates with no respect.The sales techniques used by management are too aggressive and often scare customers away.The store is always a mess due to understaffing.Management often disregard or talk badly about upper management. e.g. Merchandising manager talking badly about design concepts, telling associates how ugly some of the clothes are, trying to cut corners.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I really don't know where you find your management but just because somebody has experience or training does not mean they are qualified to be a manager. Being able to communicate with employees in a respectable manner is more important. Also having more employees so you can give them small shifts that are spread apart may be a fiscal benefit but the atmosphere of the actual stores suffer, and who wants to shop in a store where everybody working there hates it?</advice-to-management>

“Great part-time job in clothing retail!”

</title><pros>Pros – Extremely flexible hours, managment in my experience has nothing short of outstanding. Great handle on work-life balance; you will never be guilted into taking on extra hours or taking on tasks that negatively affect your non-work life. Given the pay and the amount of hours available outside the holiday season, you will need a second job, but the company culture makes this extremely possible.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Even with your 30-60% discount, most purchases are well out of reach considering non-managment pay. You are not required to wear J Crew clothing, but the dress code is very strict (a good portion of the men's clothing lines are not allowable under current guidelines). The path to promotion and developing a career within J Crew starting from within the retail side is hazy at best. Very female-dominated work culture, expect to feel out of place if you are a man, particularly if you are married and are in your early-mid twenties. Many of my co-workers and I have college degrees and are working retail for side/additional income, but no communication regarding career advancement is available. If given the chance, I'm sure many of us would take advantage of any opportunities for professional career development within the retail industry.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Fomalize the training process for support associates, particularly when it comes to backstocking and merchandising. Streamline merchandising procedures so that items are more locatable. Item locations can change multiple times a week, making tracking down customer requests a time-consuming and difficult task. Promote from within, and give your hard-working and educated associates opportunities to develop their leadership skills and provide a clearer path to career development.</advice-to-management>

“Associate”

</title><pros>Pros – Cool clothes, laid back, fun. The associate discount was amazing, especially at the outlet stores. I could get shorts / jeans / sweaters / dress shirts / ties, all for around $20 depending on the season. Not too many employee's worked at my store, so we all knew eachother and got plenty of hours.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management turnover was pretty high at my store. WIthin 5 months of being hired only one or two of the managers that hired me were still there.Sometimes the hours were too long. I would be asked countless times to stay late or come in early.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Collaboration with the schedule! Countless times I would say I couldn't work a certain day to almost every manager, put it in "the book", and I would still get asked to work. On weeks with limited availability I'd be scheduled to work almost 35hours, then when I said I had open availability I would get 8 because the right person never got word of the change.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Pretty good merchandiseGreat brand partnerships (Barbour, Alden, Red Wing, New Balance, Baracuta, Timex)Mickey is THE MAN!  Love that guy!We had fun at work (although I hear there's a new regime that has outlawed fun in NYC stores)</pros>
<cons>Cons – I have one complaint: I worked in NYC so people from JCrew Corporate came in to our store all the time (weekly visuals walk throughs for starters).  Invariably they were arrogant and treated us with total disdain and contempt. They didn't seem to know or care about how the floor actually functioned because they never came in on a crazy Saturday afternoon.  We actually had one guy from 770 (Corp office) that would come into our store, lock himself in the manager's office for several hours and watch the security monitors looking for employee violations (didn't fold enough, didn't replenish enough, forgot to clean out a fitting room, etc). Functionally speaking there are so many instances of abject failure that I can not list them in the space provided here. From merchandising to design, quality assurance, planning, allocation and distribution I've got examples of incompetence by them all.  And yet they all think they are God's gift to retail in whatever capacity they serve. In general their attitude is deplorable towards floor associates.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – With all corporate employees getting half day Fridays during summer, it wouldn't be too much to require all corporate employees work one full Saturday or Sunday shift at a high volume NYC store (i.e. not The Liquor Store) each year - preferably during the fall / holiday when extra help is needed. Let them see first hand what it's like.</advice-to-management>

“No room for growth CALL CENTER”

</title><pros>Pros – Sample Sales, Decent Pay, All you do is sit for 8 hours and take around 5 calls at the San Antonio call center. It's 10.75 HR (Not super great for a call center though)</pros>
<cons>Cons – One mistake can get you fired. Sooo many people were let go for tiny reasons. I have my degree in Fashion Merchandising and HR still did not even consider me for the Personal Shopper position after a year of being in customer service. So if you work at the call center you'll always be just customer service theres no future with J.Crew</cons>

“great for short”

</title><pros>Pros – Provide basic health insurance coverage for part time employees (at least in the distribution centers) so it is perfect for college students. It accepts feedback from customers and employees and often implements changes.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This company is great if you know how to kiss up. If you do not, then you will never be promoted. Also, the mandatory overtime can become excessive especially if you have another job or you are in school and are already stretched to the limit.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The health insurance coverage for both part time & full time employees is great! If new duties are added to an already full job description, it may be time to create new positions.</advice-to-management>

“Great Company with a clear vision.”

</title><pros>Pros – The longer I work for J. Crew, the more I like about the company.  The company is continually pushing to improve itself.  You can tell that senior management has a clear, and structured approach to grow the company's/brand's reputation and standing in the fashion retail world.I have a much better work/life balance since I have started working for J. Crew.  I generally work 40-42 hours each week.  There have been occasional weeks that I have had to work more, but for the most part, my work week stays at 40 hours.  At previous employers, I would generally work a minimum of 45-50 hours in a typical week.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the systems of the company are a little dated, but as I stated earlier, there is a plan in place to modernize the company.</cons>
<advice-to-management> – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>

“Bad hours, lack of respect.”

</title><pros>Pros – DiscountLate wakeupsSome friendly employeesNot too much more else positive to say about the company</pros>
<cons>Cons – Just about everything else!Competitive salespeopleOverpriced clothingNo foot trafficLack of respect for time! I was constantly on call–minimum 4 times a week, and I had to revolve my whole schedule around that, but I was almost never needed. It is illegal to have someone on call that much (I looked it up and it can be only 2 times per week in my state). The worst is that sometimes the night before they will cancel shifts or make them on calls if the store is not doing well. I know it's not because I am incompetent because it is happening to my coworkers as well, and I have been a successful sales person at another store.I'm an Ivy-League student but I was treated as though I was incompetent.</cons>

“Cool atmosphere, terrible scheduling”

</title><pros>Pros – Management are nice and friendly and fairly flexible, including some senior management who will pop in from time-to-time, decent staff discount</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hours are horrendous, scheduling completed weekly and at times only 1-2 days before the week begins, heavy use of "On Call" shifts meaning you never know if you'll actually pick up hours or not, and there is no hesitation by management to simply not schedule you for a week. Wages are low, associate commission is almost non-existant, and bonuses are only received when store meets plan (which is not always realistic).</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Bump up the hours and start scheduling bi-weekly. It's retail, so nobody expects to have really high wages but there needs to be a little bit of cooperation.</advice-to-management>

“the vacation package is awesome, however the management treats us all like uneducated neanderthals.”

</title><pros>Pros – the ONLY good reason to work there is you get 28 days of vacation your first year, and if you are crazy enough to stay there five years, you receive another 5 days of vacation. we also get 6 paid holidays.</pros>
<cons>Cons – we have absolutely no sick time available to us, unscheduled time off results in "occurances" that build towards termination; our hours are constantly cut back to 35 a week (the minimum gauranteed in the employee handbook); there is no actual training department, therefore associates are required to train other associates, without option of extra pay or recognition; we are required to cross-train in every department and meet production standards no matter how long it has been since you last performed any certain task; production standards on some tasks are unrealistic at best, laughable on others; the human resources department is a joke, catering to certain individuals and doing nothing for all others; management is terrible, they treat us like emotionless machines and hairless apes.</cons>

“Great Experience So Far!”

</title><pros>Pros – The J.Crew distribution center is a great place to build up your resume if your looking for experience. You are constantly engaged with customers from all over the U.S. and must quickly solve customer conflicts on a daily basis. This position also helps with communication skills, as you are on the phone through  the duration of your shift. Proper usage of words and verifying important information is something you can take to any position you looking for in the future.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the management staff may look like they are not doing much. Their main purpose is to assist you if you have any major questions, which is helpful the first week on the call center floor. After that first week however, you may see them shooting the breeze with other associates while you are bombarded with customer calls. They are a great help, but it may be smarter to have conversations that are non-work related away from working associates.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to new associate comments carefully. Some actually have great ideas on how to improve company performance. Also, try to help new employees get comfortable with other employees on the floor. New hires at companies often keep to themselves or only speak with other new hires like themselves. Get them involved with the rest of the J.Crew family so they have a more positive experience from the beginning of their hire date.</advice-to-management>

“An okay work environment, but not worth the effort.”

</title><pros>Pros – Overall, your schedule is pretty flexible with respect to your availability and the pay is pretty standard for a sales associate.  The employee discount is also very generous, particularly with respect to clearance items.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hours are sometimes very low and can vary widely from week to week.  Management also tries to keep shifts in the 4-5 hour range, which can be annoying if you have much of a commute.  The use of on-call shifts can be nerve wracking as well, as it really limits your ability to make plans.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Try to make sales associates feel more valued.  It's hard to stay motivated when turnover is so high that you can't even keep up with your coworkers.</advice-to-management>

“like working with clothing”

</title><pros>Pros – The people that we meet every day.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Everything we get in shipment comes in plastic bags. Never get a run of items, always the same sizes sent.  Not all customers are a 0 or 2 and they get upset when we don't have item. Wish our registers could keep up with what it sold and send item to replace, not stuff we have enough of.</cons>

“Fantastic environment to interact with people.”

</title><pros>Pros – you meet new people every day. you learn about style and therefore get a good sense for fashion. You learn how to dress and be versatile with your wardrobe. The people you work with, at least in my store, are always in a good mood and willing to help out. Its also good to receive compliments when customers like the outfit that you are wearing. It makes you feel good, and it makes them think about possibly getting that item for themselves as well.</pros>
<cons>Cons – When it gets busy, it GETS BUSY. but that's just part of the business. Sometimes customers might think they are royalty, but you learn to deal with that type. Overall, the only con I can think of is closing time when people in the store come in, make a mess, and don't buy anything. They make you clean up their mess. Then again, that's what you're getting paid to do.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Not all, but at least for some, when you talk to an employee, and you just got promoted to a "key holder" don't talk to us as if you've been a manager for 8 years and give us that sense of superiority when delegating, explaining, or informing us of certain things.  ANYONE can be a key holder, don't think that you just got promoted to vice president or CEO of the company.</advice-to-management>

“Of part time employers, this has definitely been my favorite job and even through college, I stayed 2 yrs+ !!!”

</title><pros>Pros – Fashion forward company, insurance and 401k options, company treats you with respect, a fun and laid back environment!</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is difficult to take time off sometimes and often it feels as if we are short staffed and there are few people able to cover shifts if something comes up.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It would be nice to have many more people employed even if that means fewer hours per associate so that in the event something comes up you are more likely to get a shift covered. I know that since I have been at J.Crew more than 20 people I know of have quit because of this being a problem.</advice-to-management>

“My experience has felt inviting, understanding, paced, and educational.”

</title><pros>Pros – In my opinion, J.Crew is a great place to work at because it's the right balance of business. So many retail stores are either completely mobbed all the time or dead to the world and J.Crew is the mediation of the two. The managers work with you and help support you in doing what you feel most comfortable doing.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The starting hours are very low but it just depends on what season you start in. Business picks up more during certain parts of the year.</cons>

<cons>Cons – It's hard to deal with micro-managing individuals who make it miserable to be at work. I'm working on commission-obviously I want to have good sales. The woman really was horrible to employees and had no life outside that store. She created a stressful environment for customers to the point where people felt hounded and not relaxed when they were shopping. She had us pouncing on people right and left. Very uncomfortable for us and customers. Our sales weren't good overall for the region either--shocker.</cons>

“Better place to work compared to other retailers...”

</title><pros>Pros – Most of my co-workers were nice and the managers were enthusiastic, respectable, and professional. The company does take the time to recognize successful employees for both their small and great achievements (good customer service, a fantastic sale, etc.). The managers were very good about making sure employees took breaks according to legal standards.There are many different positions - stock support, cashiers, sales associates, etc. If you like variety, there's opportunity to move around and try different things.As a store with a big fan following, many customers adore the product and are a pleasure to work with. The company encourages you to go the extra mile to make it a great experience for the customer, so they do let you take ownership in dealing with many issues, and your hard work is often rewarded with loyal, appreciative customers.The employees with full-time positions (personal shoppers, visual assistants, etc.) were good at what they did and seemed happy working there. The benefits for full-time employees is good. (There are benefits for part-time employees, but it's not that great.) J.Crew is a good place to work part-time for students or people just looking for something to do. The employee discount is a reason to work there by itself!I left when I found a full-time job elsewhere, but if my circumstances change later in life, I'd definitely consider going back to help with shipment and rollout (it's fun being the first person to see the new stuff, and the hours are more consistent).</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you depend on your job for income to pay bills, the hours you may need aren't always available. They schedule a lot of on-call shifts - the penalty for not calling is the same as not showing up for work, but you get no reward for being prepared to work that shift. If you do want more hours/have a more open availability, the hours you get can also be all over the place - you may close late at night and then be back to open bright and early. This can be especially rough during extended holiday hours. You also will be expected to have some sort of weekend availability - but that's standard in retail.The pay is moderately fair - probably better than many retailers, but nothing to get too excited about.The company also has a lot of standards for folding, hanging clothes, etc. While I admit a certain fondness for a perfectly folded stack of sweaters, the 2-3 hour closings that are necessary to create those picture-perfect piles can be a bit tedious.My biggest disappointment with the company was the lack of education about policies and products - I had a short orientation with the handbook and a cheesy video, and from there figured out a lot by myself (no shadowing, etc.). I'm sure that a lot of this has to do with the high turnover rate in part-time retail.</cons>

“First few years fantastic. Not very good now”

</title><pros>Pros – Great benefits, fair compensation, great brand name, 401k, fantastic discounts, retail, direct, Madewell, and factory to chose from, internal growth up to a point</pros>
<cons>Cons – No promotion or growth potential. No leadership from the senior management. poor direction from senior management, mixed signals with no clear direction. Extreme workload with minimal employee hours.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be confident in your own abilities, you will not recieve any direction from your suppiriors. Compencation is fair, but it doesnt meet the workload. Each year the alloted employee hours are reduced. even if it is a great and profitable year. All programs are not thought thru, the are peiced together at the last min with no direction</advice-to-management>

“Great place to work!”

</title><pros>Pros – Great discount, fun-loving staff/colleagues, young managers, good hours/work & life balance, good pay, part-time associates are elligible for benefits</pros>
<cons>Cons – Corporate management sometimes has unrealistic expectations of sales produced in this slow economy.  Sales goals for associates and the store remain largely the same, even with less people shopping and spending money.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It would be great for the leadership to come into one of the "regular" stores--not a super selling store in NY, etc.  Learn what it's like "down in the trenches" for your sales staff.</advice-to-management>

“Flexible & Fun”

</title><pros>Pros – J. Crew management is very flexible when it comes to your schedule.  The environment is very relaxed but everyone typically has a desire to work hard and help customers.  The discount is AWESOME.</pros>
<cons>Cons – In the past management isn't always the best with communicating with each other.  You might get certain information from Manager A and conflicting information from Manager B.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Try and figure our a better way to communicate.  Or only let one person handle certain things.  Also I think schedules need to be available online - but just in the store.</advice-to-management>

“Sales Support”

</title><pros>Pros – -Great discount-Good brand-Good people</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not much opportunity for advancement for those in the retail stores.  Promotions seem to be given to a select few.   You rarely know your schedule in advance, so hard to schedule anything. Schedule is a moving target as Corporate likes to micro-manage the stores hours Retail employees are definitely the step children of the company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – -Job postings site for retail employees (for both retail and Corporate positions)-Give the retail managers more control of their business; give them hours to work with on a quarterly basis instead of weekly/monthly. It's frustrating for everyone to have their schedules changed/cut at the last minute.-walk in our shoes:  realize how it feels to have your hours cut all the time (for you it would mean having your salary cut on a weekly basis) and not having a consistent schedule-A more consistent work environment would translate to happier harder working employees who feel that they are respected, resulting in less of a revolving door.</advice-to-management>

“Overall good experience”

</title><pros>Pros – It's a nice part-time job to have while in college. The hours are flexible, and it gives you good retail experience if you wish to pursue corporate retail positions.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The hours can be annoying, since you do have to work nights and weekends. If you don't work well with people, this is obviously not the place for you. It would be nice to occasionally hear more positive feedback from the management and customer.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Find a way of getting feedback to give sales associates - both positive and negative. I also think it would be helpful if there was more training implemented when people are initially hired.</advice-to-management>
