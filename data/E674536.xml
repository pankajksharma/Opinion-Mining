“Intern”

</title><pros>Pros – Great place to start your journey in the professional world. The team is very friendly and flexible and offer a lot of insight on the technical aspect of architecture practices. They are specialized in the healthcare sectors with clients all over the east coast. I would recommend and undergraduate student interested in learning the inner works of architecture i.e. building codes, design phases to look into it.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No really a con but there is little to no room for growing in the firm as it is a small firm.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
