“Will work here any day!”

</title><pros>Pros – I have been working with USTS for a long time. I still work here. We have a product the is being developed and I am part owner of the product, in other words, when the product sells, I will get residual income whether I work for USTS or not. Also, I received interest free loans when I needed help the most - to get my sister married. I cannot forget what they did for me. Salary is paid on the first of every month. Never a delay and they pay well, including lakh & over in bonuses.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Long hours, yes. But if i or any one in my family have a medical emergency or any issues atall, this company has always let me work from home. Given me extra money if my medical bills are more than what I can manage. They have been very fair. If you think of this company as your own and put in your 100% work, this is a great company to work with.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>

“Not employee friendly”

</title><pros>Pros – Good office location good colleagues</pros>
<cons>Cons – Employees are being treated as daily wagers.  You won't get any benefits when leaving company.  Will give negative feedback when some calls/comes for verification or background enquiry.  Won't giv any documents like pay slip or any letter when we are in need. Will get only one document from company, that's offer letter.  If you are lucky enough you may get relieving letter. There is no pf here. Think twice before you decide to join there..</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Nothing... tried giving many when I was ter. You won't even learn from past experience.  Thats why employee strength become 4 from 40...</advice-to-management>
