“Worst management ever”

</title><pros>Pros – gym atmosphere so health oriented</pros>
<cons>Cons – No communication with staff, no praise or even notice or awareness for a job well done, paychecks often paid late with no apologies from management for how disruptive this can be, absentee ownership, high staff turnover, negative atmosphere due to customer dissatisfaction because of lack of response from owners to legitimate concerns</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Yes, 'everyone is expendable', we all know that, but it is taken to the extreme here. A little appreciation for the staff goes a long way, after all, we are the face of your company.  Especially given you are hardly ever there to deal with customer issues, leaving the staff with little tools, resources or training to manage the customers.  Suggestion: have regular staff meetings to keep the team involved and engaged; recognize that some people truly do a good job and deserve recognition; have an owner at each location daily to help manage customer concerns; apologize when paychecks are late.  Many people live paycheck to paycheck and may need that $8 an hour to buy groceries on Friday for their children.  Not getting paid until Monday or Tuesday instead may cause great hardship. It seems your attitude is that you are doing your employees a favor by paying them at all.</advice-to-management>
