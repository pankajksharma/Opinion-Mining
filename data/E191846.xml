When there is a crisis, the boss doesn't have your back, your're on your own. The client base is stagnant and needs to be expanded to increase revenue.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – If you feel an employee's idea is something that doesn't work for you, you should be upfront and not lead them on. Communicate better with the staff about studio hours of operation cutbacks. Be consistant.</advice-to-management>
