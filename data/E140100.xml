“i am 200% happy and proud to be part of the E-Citron adventure”

</title><pros>Pros – - team motivation & dynamisme : an incredible working environment where each and everyone is included- self building & opportunities : learning-by-doing, my initiatives are welcomed and ideas are asked for- projects & company vision : crystal clear and honest management and operational / financial direction- day-to-day work is not day-to-day : with a 'one-to-one' basis, each client is different, each client has a special attention- open mind : a long way from big advertising agencies, here i know my work is necessary for the company to keep going - we are all working together, with a common goal, and without any internal-political-games.</pros>
<cons>Cons – - pressure & expectations from clients are very high - being lazy on the job is a rare pleasure- need to be self-driven and self-motivated to go further : although the environment is positive, it is necessary to anticipate and not to be afraid to try and learn. Learning by doing is also difficult sometimes.- often long hours (and sometimes nights) - being flexible and reactive also means to accept some out-of-hours work, some stressful deadlines or some week-end work.- a team of 15-20 persons means the downside of the global 'ants-nest' you could find in a global-international company. So sometimes, lack of external ideas and visions.</cons>
