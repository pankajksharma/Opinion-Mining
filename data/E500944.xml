“If you're innovative and looking to do new things, keep looking!”

<cons>Cons – One agenda - NOT THE CHILDREN!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – LEAVE!  You need new fresh blood in that organization!  Innovative new ideas...  People that are out learning the trends and applying them... not a CEO & COO waiting for retirement and not out to take the company into new territory.  And stop using agency cars for personal stuff.  Most senior mgmt don't have personal cars and use the agency cars for EVERYTHING including vacation.  Not only do they have gas cards, but toll responders.  They go to the supermarket, on the agency's dime!  Something is NOT right about it... And most of the senior mgmt have agency cars!  Where's the real audit where senior management work/meeting schedules are compared to the mileage on the vehicles???PS. There are leaders younger than Jack Welch with new management techniques... See Goldman and the concept of leading with emotional intelligence.</advice-to-management>
