<title>

“Great place to work during college.”

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible with working hours, whatever times suit you and as many or as few shifts as you like. Good pay for college students in Ireland.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No integration of field team with the rest of the company. No insight into how data is analysed or what clients' goals are. Does not give field staff a holistic view of the organisation.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Give field staff a more holistic induction to the company. I.e. do not just show them how to conduct interviews and use equipment etc. Give them a presentation on the history of the company and it's current strategy / targets.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
