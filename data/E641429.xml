“A job for the young”

</title><pros>Pros – Its great pay for the type of work. Its pretty easy and mindless! Customers are nice for the most part. A good job for high school or college students. Hours and shifts are very flexible.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very unprofessional! Too much drama! Employees are allowed too much freedom and are too trusted! No proper reprocussions for bad choices ( being rude to customers, and treating fellow employees with disrespect). There is just no professionalism.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Need proper rules set in place for employee conduct.</advice-to-management>
