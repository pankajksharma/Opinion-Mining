“Fun screenprinting operation”

</title><pros>Pros – I like the fact that w e printed single custom tshirts because there was a lot of interaction with the customers. It was a fun environment and so busy that time went very quickly. There was always something to do and I was never bored!</pros>
<cons>Cons – We would accept rush orders from customers that had left it to the last minute to have their printing done. These were often complicated and short run jobs that were frankly a pain to have to do.... they were profitable though!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The owners a lovely people to work for but they should stop accepting rush jobs at the last minute.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
