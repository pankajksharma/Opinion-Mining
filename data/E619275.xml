“Smiling Faces Tell Lies”

</title><pros>Pros – Way more flexible than a corporate restaurantAttractive co-workers (only hot girls and good looking guys get hired)Chaos, for people into that</pros>
<cons>Cons – Things start off rosy until things slowly get ugly. The owner and his wife (and their family) frequently are very unprofessional, their personal lives can leak into or explode in the kitchen or when no customers are around. Pettiness and questionable activities are common. Racial and racist comments happen sometimes.</cons>
