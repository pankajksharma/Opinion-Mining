“Cheap hotel owner operating unethically!”

</title><pros>Pros – These hotel owners have no redeeming qualities when it comes to working with them.</pros>
<cons>Cons – These owners try to save as much money as they can, once referring to every expense as their "personal expense".  This reflects very poorly on the condition of their hotels and the reviews on TripAdvisor.  I had to file a law suit in Small Claims Court after they refused to pay my last paycheck in accordance to CO Labor Law.  The parent company is Khan Hotels.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – These owners should not be in the hotel industry.  She and her husband buy budget hotels and run them into the ground like a cash cow.  This is a refection on the overall hospitality industry.</advice-to-management>
