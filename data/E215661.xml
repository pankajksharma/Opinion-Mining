<employee-type>Intern (Former Employee)</employee-type>
<title>

“Advertising agency.”

</title><pros>Pros – The people are really creative, energetic, and fun to be around. It's a casual environment, so ideas can easily flow between departments. There's a long break for lunch every day, and a pool outside. There are a lot of exciting projects you ca be involved in, and the graphic designers are very talented. There is a collegial feel, and most employees are in their 20s and 30s; they are friends outside of work. RTA helps out their interns too, putting them on teams to do research and benchmarking for clients. I created several presentations, and learned a lot about other companies internationally.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the downsides for interns is that it is unpaid, and there are long hours. Though you do not have to work hard for all 10-12 hours that you are there every day, it is a long work day. You can learn a lot, if you seek out people and the resources there. However, if you do not take the initiative you will not be given any non-tedious work. Also, the company is somewhat far away and isolated from the city. You definitely need a ride to get to and from work, which can also be intense toward deadlines.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Senior management is very helpful, and is generally open and receptive to feedback.</advice-to-management>
