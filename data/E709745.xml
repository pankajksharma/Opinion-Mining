“Can't meet production deadlines.”

</title><pros>Pros – Easy drive to and from work.  The parking lot is plowed early during the winter.  Seriously - not too many pros about working there anymore.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Paychecks bounce 4-5 times a year.  President of company can not be trusted, He lies to employees about why their paychecks bounced and his didn't.  Lies to customers about delivery dates of product -if he says 4 weeks, it is 6 weeks ( this is on fully prepaid orders.)  Lies to vendors about delivery dates, tells them "the check must have been lost in the mail." or my accountant forgot to send the check when in fact he does not have the money to pay for the supplies.</cons>
