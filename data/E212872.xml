“Best Place I've Ever Worked!!!”

</title><pros>Pros – Great benefits; work/life balance; love working for a company that has such a strong sense of giving back and philanthropy; upper management has an open door policy and is very approachoable.  I've worked for several large companies in the past, and it's so refreshing to work for a family-owned business that values employees and treats them with respect.</pros>
<cons>Cons – More training at the property level so employees understand company policies/procedures better and know what's expected of them.  I would also like to see upper management be onsite at the properties more often to build better relationships with the staff.</cons>

“They don't appreciate their staff”

</title><pros>Pros – Decent pay, Great benefits and paid holidays.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very stressful, lack of training for new hires on site. Fire employees on medical leave.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – On the surface this company seems to care about its employees and offers great benefits and decent pay for the industry. However, after my personal experience with them, I don't believe this to be true any longer. I was a new hire (2 weeks) and was involved in an accident at the start of my 3rd week. I was out for one week on my doctor's orders and was not completely cleared back to work, when the Property Manager called to let me go. This goes to show how they truly feel about their employees.</advice-to-management>

“Used to be the top company in it's field”

</title><pros>Pros – Good benefits from profit sharing to health insurance. Apartment discounts. PTO and Vacation leave. Travel while at work reimbursement.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Does not promote from within. Will not listen to employee concerns.  Does not listen to resident concerns. Completely ignores corporate policy manuals. Ignores american disabilities acts as well labor laws as they exist today. When Mr. Glick was still in charge, they were the top in the industry, now that Mr. Barrett is the CEO, they are ignoring Mr. Glick's  ideals and reason's for getting into the apartment industry. Do not speak your mind, especially if you have supporting evidence. It will be ignored.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to your employees. Follow the policies in your manuals rather than create new policies to suit the situation. Your technical staff has a better and more accurate ear to what the resident concerns are than the Property Managers. To much power is granted for the Property Managers as well as the HR staff.</advice-to-management>

“Don't Be Fooled”

</title><pros>Pros – Gene B. Glick offers an impressive benefit package including medical, dental, vision, life, and 401K. Even in your first year, you are given two weeks paid vacation and 40 hrs personal time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The management in this company has taken a drastic downward turn. Lower level employees are treated disrespectfully, and are expected to complete tasks entirely outside of their job description. The stress level is extreme, and no one with a direct supervisor tends to stay with the company for more than a couple of months.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Gene B. Glick needs to take a look at the past before moving forward. You used to be an outstanding company with whom people desired to work. Your name is now tarnished. I would not recommend employment with Gene B Glick to anyone.</advice-to-management>

“Not What It Used To Be”

</title><pros>Pros – The benefit package offered is exceptionally nice. Retirement plan is generous. Good health care options and the company also offers short and long term disability plans at no cost to the employee.</pros>
<cons>Cons – During the last year the company has made several changes. More and more is expected at the site level and each site is very micromanaged. More responsibilities are added, however, staff members have been deleted, and customer service is expected not to suffer. Corporate Management Staff offer little support and praise, only criticism. Mr. Glick has stepped aside and others are leading in a way that many do not feel that he would approve of.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Reevaluate and eliminate unnecessary reports, paperwork and procedures. Take a step back and compare whether the way we do things is the best way. Eliminate and lessen the amount of hands and eyes needed to make decisions so things can be done quickly and more efficiently.</advice-to-management>

“Gene Glick Management's employee satisfaction is on a drastic decline due to increased stress levels.”

</title><pros>Pros – Gene Glick Management has the best retirement package.  I receive 15% of my annual salary added to my 401k account by only contributing 2% of my own money.  I think that is a great incentative to keep employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The downside is that in the last year the company has begun to change in many ways.  Many employees at the lower levels have felt pressure from has been handed down from higher management.  The lower level employess are not paid to deal with the same pressure and stresses that upper level management is expected to handle.  This has made it hard for me to keep employees.  Many of them quit stating that too much is expected of them for the pay they receive.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Many senior management people have been away from the field for many year.  Many things have changed since they were in the field and I think many times they fail to realize what we have to deal with.  They keep adding pressure to the field by adding more responsibilites.  They fail to realize that the added responsibilities affect each property differently.</advice-to-management>

“Manager's don't have a clue.”

</title><pros>Pros – Great way to build new relationships. The benefits the company offers are the best I have ever received from a company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lack of knowledge between management. There seems to be a constant fluctuation of employees between properties and the home office. You can never get the same answer from someone. Although the benefits are great, I find the compensation to be lacking. I know of similar companies that pay their employees for the same jobs more on the hour and offer more for their sales. It's discouraging to be given so little for so much effort and work.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
