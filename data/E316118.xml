“Great small firm”

</title><pros>Pros – Very diverse practise.  Opportunuty to experience many different kinds of businesses.  Challenging accounting problems. Flexible working arrangements. Nice people in general.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Mostly women employees....some catty-ness.  Boss is frequently impatient and can say things I'm sure he later regrets.  Compared to other public accounting firms this one is much better on this score.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more patient with new employees.  Assign more senior employees to train rather than trying yourself.  You're no good at it.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
