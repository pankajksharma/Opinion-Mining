“Interviewee Beware of Account Manager Position”

</title><pros>Pros – This is a family company and they have people who have worked here for many years. They have a very non corporate vibe at the office. Lisa the owner is fantastic.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company on a whole is quite antiquated on new business processes and efficiencies. They have no master software so everything is manual and a bit redundant. They have a revolving door on their "account manager" position because it's not really an account manager position, instead it is a costing position for for design. I checked and pretty much every year they have someone new in this role because what they advertise is not very accurate on what you will being doing day to day. Also, they don't empower people because it is a small team of long term people and upper management is not focused on developing the skills of their workers - it's basically doing what your told versus actually thinking.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
