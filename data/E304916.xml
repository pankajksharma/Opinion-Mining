“Up & Coming Provider of IT Service Management Solutions”

</title><pros>Pros – A great place to work, if you are interested in traveling and working with both small, medium, and large companies (Fortune 100).  The management approach at DL.Q is very hands off.  The management team developed a culture that ensures all consultants receive a fair percentage of the client bill rate.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Sometimes management is a bit too hands off and will expect that admins, staff, and consultants have things under control regarding internal projects.  Not a great place to work for those who don't like working from home or traveling.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please consider adding a manager to handle the various internal projects that are part of the organization's strategic plan.</advice-to-management>
