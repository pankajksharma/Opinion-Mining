“Great environment with passionate developers”

</title><pros>Pros – * Develop in Python* Passionate developers who will help you learn* Fun, laid-back environment</pros>
<cons>Cons – * There can be quite a bit of nerd ego, but it is manageable* Things change frequently - company goals aren't always clear* Little communication from lead management on why things are done the way they are* People seem to get promoted more from a$$-kissing than for the work that they do. Loyalty seems overly important.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Communicate more with your employers about your strategic direction, and your longer-term goals for each of the sites you maintain.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
