“Winsoft... the worst employer”

</title><pros>Pros – They have good clients. You may get some good work if you are lucky else be a part of the hell.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Worst work culture, Worst Management, Worst environment, lots of politics etc. Only join winsoft if you are not satisfied with your peaceful life. You will get guaranteed nightmares once you join them. Despite of years of hard work, you never know one fine day you will get demoted and somebody with lesser experience or no experience in the relevant will be appointed as your boss.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be professional and try to build professional culture in the organization, Study some good management lessons and learn something and please be human to the employees.
