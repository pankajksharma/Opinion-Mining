“OK Company with Extremely High Turnover”

</title><pros>Pros – Excellent learning opportunity and chance for career advancement (if you don't get randomly laid off)</pros>
<cons>Cons – The turnover here is crazy... In less than a year the company hired and fired no less than 6 people for the same exact position. Then I too was laid off and told by the CEO that she did not want to discuss the reason why.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Vet your selections a bit more before making them an offer... It's pretty messed up to offer someone a position, have then leave their current position then lay them off a week or two into their new job.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
