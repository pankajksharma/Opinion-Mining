“I Can is a cash cow for the founders, awful place to work as a teacher.”

</title><pros>Pros – It was a very clean building, with air conditioning.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They say you have over an hour of planning, that's because they make you show up an hour before school starts. No duty free lunch, impossible work requirements, crappy pay, condescending/under qualified deans, no curriculum, you have to make lesson plans from scratch and guess at what they want to see, they over enroll (I had 52 on my roster at the start of the year), They don't provide their teachers with anything except paper and border to decorate the room. Their teacher retention probably has the worst percentage in our continent. In theory what they say during training is awesome, but in reality what they provide and execute is crap. They execute crap every time. Ask anybody who works there (if they still work there),</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Maybe don't spend all of the money you get for the school on tailored suits, newest model Range Rovers, and getting loaded nightly at flashy martini bars. Maybe, stop making false promises to parents about providing a top notch education. Maybe tell them it's possible their child will end up crammed in a small room with 51 other dollars, I mean scholars.</advice-to-management>
