“It was terrible.”

</title><pros>Pros – The club provides regular classes and has fairly new equipment. When I was there there was no broken equipment as far as I could tell.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This club absolutely does not care about its customers and its employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please take the time to look after your customers. Your entire system of administration is set up to disadvantage the customer who wants to quit for whatever reason. I don't know whether you are aware of it or not, but there are many people who dislike your club. Customers have the impression that you don't take responsibility for their items, for their experience, and for their well being in general.</advice-to-management>
