<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – They should hire a third party HR consultancy company to create their job descriptions, grades and so on, or at least by survey salary targeting their region and the regions they don't wanna loose, or they wanna take employees from.Instead of asking people to work more than 40 hours a week, they should provide directions and deadlines and push the team to meet themThere should be more alignment between the board members including the investors. This would save us hours of unecessary meetings and work, and would give usmuch more clarity about which direction we should strive our forces.There would be more delegation in place, thus sharing the workload and responsibility amongst incumbents of leadership positions. Otherwise there is no need of having leadership roles in place.</advice-to-management>
