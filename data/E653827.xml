“Verbally abusive employer, long hours, no rewards, dissorganized”

</title><pros>Pros – You get paid federal holidays</pros>
<cons>Cons – Employer verbally assaults employees. No clear instruction is provided. If mistake is made, you receive no direction on how to correct your error, and will be verbally assaulted and deal with a mood swing for the rest of the day. No recognition for a job well done. Very long hours with no paid overtime. Unclear company polices on things such as sick or personal days, how things are done, or who to report to with a company issue (no HR).</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Treat your employees like you would your clients.</advice-to-management>
