“Comfortable but no promise of career growth”

</title><pros>Pros – Very understanding managers who do their best to accommodate their employees. The pay was decent. 2 weeks of vacation/year with unlimited sick hours. Would receive Christmas gift cards and company sponsored lunches.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I got the feeling that I would have a very limited opportunity for moving up in the company, but they are a contractor for other bigger companies and are at mercy to those they work for. Supervisors are very nice but lack the skills/requirements/schooling to be in their position. Pay could have been better but again, the fact that they are contracted means that their employees will receive less than the non-contracted workers. What I hated the most were the terrible health benefits which were costly per month because of how small of a company P/Strada is.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – P/Strada needs to choose their supervisors more wisely and hire a supervisor who knows every process. They should also expand their company and hire more employees by making themselves more widely known because, lets face it: not many have heard of their company.</advice-to-management>
