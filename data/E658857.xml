“Lighthearted Company that doesn't take things serious. That includes YOU.”

</title><pros>Pros – You can make a difference because there are so many areas that need to be improved.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Pay is satisfactory if you keep in shape, find a spouse with millions, and don't want withdraw from their savings for lunch money. Company does not like giving reviews so you can make an educated guess as to how you are performing and how you can improve. You will earn more responsibilities with little to no pay increase and no job title change. This company looks at an employee for what they are, not what they could be if only they had a little guidance and growth opportunity.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Take a look around and try to understand how your company operates. Take more care in the engineering process of your product instead of using consumers as test dummies. Don't ask employees to handle your own personal matters when they are already booked with duties within their job description.</advice-to-management>
