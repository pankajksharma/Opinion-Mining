“Not much personal growth, or salary growth. Company has a vision for staying status quo.”

</title><pros>Pros – Current manager allows flex time and doesn't micro manage. Does allow you to take two hours for doctor appointments or other family issues within the day and doesn't require you to take vacation time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low pay and no vision beyond current year for the company. Doesn't promote personal growth. Probably like many corporations, revenue is king at the expense of the employees. Current management doesn't address the cancer of low moral and discontent within the company. The apparent response to these issues is that we should be lucky to have a job.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Treat your employees as your most valuable asset. Look at ways to be more on the cutting edge of compensation packages without strings attached that make it seem like a slap in the face. Last Summer hour initiative required everyone to sign in because they didn't trust the employees ours or their managers. Look at ways to provide the employees with the tools need to perform their jobs more efficiently. Whether it be looking to technology or hiring additional personnel to do tasks that should be relegated to a lower level position.</advice-to-management>
