<cons>Cons – Owner doesn't care about the company or the employees at all. He is just in it for the money for himself. You get criticized and yelled at. After their recent change in management the company has gone down the tubes. Nobody communicates and you get blamed for everything that goes wrong. The owner simply does not care anymore. He should sell the company. Everyone would be better off.</cons>
