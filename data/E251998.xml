“Take the good with the bad”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a really fair environment to work.  I got a lot of experience, and the employees are really supportive to help you develop your skills.  This is a great place to work if you want to work with competent individuals and a caring boss.  He has done a lot for his employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Unfortunately, the prices are high, and the clients are not shy about telling you so.  Because the boss is so non-confrontational, you will be asked to deal with some of his battles.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Annual performance reviews would be great to help employees maintain morale in a business that doesn't provide much positive feedback.</advice-to-management>
