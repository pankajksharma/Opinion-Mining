“High Turnover Says It All”

</title><pros>Pros – turnover is so high promotions can come quickly if you follow the corp. crap. The company does spend a pretty penny on various employee gatherings like picnics and holiday parties which almost seem to be mandatory or at least that is how it comes across from most management individuals.</pros>
<cons>Cons – long hours not good compensation for the amount of crap associates put up with from management and customers. Raises are often very low even when it comes to promotional raises. Until you get in management the long hours dont pay off.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – be careful of some of the people you are promoting they are just interested in trampling whoever they need to to look good</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
