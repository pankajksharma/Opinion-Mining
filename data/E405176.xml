“They have a lot to work on”

</title><pros>Pros – casual work environment and relatively flexible on when you come/leave until they start scheduling meetings every morning from 8-8:30a and from 5:30-6p. This seems to only be the case for Operations and Business Development. Great location of an office (close to highway). Free parking.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Intimidating and unapproachable executive team. They talk down to you and it wasn't just to me, I would see people being called out in our group meetings. They have a young business development/sales team and it definitely showed.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Relax. The CEO seems very nice and friendly at first but get in a meeting with him or ask for his "help" and he makes you feel like you are inferior to the world. I'm not suggesting he should be a push over but realize that intimidation isn't going to keep employees. I have though, heard that outside of Operations and Business Development (ie the technical team) I-Cubed is a much more enjoyable place.</advice-to-management>
