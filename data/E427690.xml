“Poor Management”

</title><pros>Pros – Coworkers were great to work with.  The pay was good for the position.  Relaxed, casual environment-there was never anyone around to "manage".  As long as your work was done that was all that mattered.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very poor management.  Could go days without seeing or hearing from management.  Would often get yelled at for things out of our control.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Unfortunately it is already too late for this company!  They are already out of business!!  They needed to pay more attention to what was happening on a daily basis.</advice-to-management>
