“Good people, real meritocracy”

</title><pros>Pros – A great place to work for go-getters who want to succeed. Minimal red tape, bureaucracy & politics. Smart, talented, aggressive (in a good way) people. Tons of advancement opportunities - sky's the limit based on how much effort/time/energy you put into it. Great compensation if you're successful.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Really long hours and crazy workloads can lead to burnout. Not a 40-50 hour/week place; not a lot of work/life balance.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Continue to work on work/life balance for your employees. Flexible hours/structures and enough down time is how you hang on to the good ones!</advice-to-management>
