<title>

“Do you like work for a a bully, being verbally abused everyday, micro managed to the max?”

</title><pros>Pros – Friendly, sympathetic co-workers who have been forced to remain employed here due to tough job market and all privately share their disgust toward the President/Owner.  After my experience here I can handle the toughest personality imaginable and has made me stronger and wiser.</pros>
<cons>Cons – President/owner is a micro manager who is unprofessional, verbally abusive and a bully.  Very high turn over at all levels.  Employees are forced to believe they are incompetent and should be greatful toward the President that he still employs them.me</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
