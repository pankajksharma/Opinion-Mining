“Disorganized, rudderless ship”

</title><pros>Pros – -Average to above average compensation IF you go above and beyond expectations-Very understaffed so...job security?</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Few clients, creating lack of "newness" to day-to-day, plus creating revenue concerns-Management is clueless regarding day-to-day functionality-Management is consistently absent, yet micro manages beyond anything I've ever experienced-VERY difficult to replicate business model across multiple clients, thus difficult to build from success</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
