“Great environment, relaxed”

</title><pros>Pros – Owner and managers are great and easy to work with, potential to make lots of $. My first year I made 6 figures with no experience</pros>
<cons>Cons – Commission only sales job. Economy really hit the industry hard, I went from making 6 figs the first yr, down to 20k the second year, and its slowly coming back, year 3 was about 40k</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management is awesome, the only thing I would ask for is more leads and since sales have taken such a hit with the economy, a higher commission rate to make up for it  would be nice.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
