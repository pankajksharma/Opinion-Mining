“Work is work”

</title><pros>Pros – Good food. Easy to get behind the product being sold and know customers are being treated to high quality ingredients, fresh produce and meticulous preparation. Friendly, low key environment to dine in and enjoy an evening or afternoon (most of the time).</pros>
<cons>Cons – Too much being stressed at times, which is to be expected within the industry, BUT it can easily tranfer over to the guests experience. When a customer feels the dining experience beyond good food and the enjoyment of their company, then it can seem as if they (the customer) have become an imposition to the restaurant (inclusive of all workers).</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Implement a proper and complete training program. Trust your employees to do their work, but do not force nominal tasks to "fill the time". One thing almost always remains in this industry, there is a guarantee that work/service/prepping/cooking is soon needed be done at any given moment...so if a time to breath shows itself, let them take a breath. Also, allowing employees a greater opportunity to sample foods, possibly even incentive with a meal every now and then lets them know they are appreciated and that you want them on board.</advice-to-management>
