“ok”

</title><pros>Pros – If you're in college and want to focus most on studies while working at a "no-thinking" job, this is the job for you.</pros>
<cons>Cons – One manager is not professional at all, which gives off a very bad impression of the work place. Other workers (younger ones) are not being held accountable for loudness/playfulness when guests have arrived to enjoy dining and atmosphere.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – More team meetings. Maybe etiquette classes a requirement for everyone.</advice-to-management>
