“Overall, not a good experience”

</title><pros>Pros – Most of the employees are hardworking, dedicated individuals who are serious about their roles as engineers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There were severe management issues with this company.  The management staff consists of engineers who have special fields of expertise, however many of them were inexperienced in dealing with the employee related issues of the company.  There were problems with the HR Division functioning properly and also with the upper level managers in working in agreement. There was such a difference of opinion in managing the company and its processes at the upper level that it affected many other employees at the division levels.  The incompatibility and the lack of professionalism created mistrust and a lack of integrity in the overall operations of the company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
