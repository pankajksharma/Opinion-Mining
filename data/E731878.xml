“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Mostly, it was the worst of times.....”

</title><pros>Pros – Pay was so-so. Benefits were actually pretty decent. Awesome place if you are all about work, because they'll give you more than you can handle....if they like you.</pros>
<cons>Cons – LONG hours. Middle management (and some upper management, for that matter) does NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! They like to talk down to you, like you're 12 years old or something, on an ongoing basis. Their idea of a reward was to give you MORE HOURS to work! Constantly changing roster of employees. Have a habit of trying to run your life for you outside of work. I believe they actually think they're the only employer on the planet.</cons>
