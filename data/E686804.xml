“Scrapbooking is going with the Dinosaurs”

</title><pros>Pros – We had donuts and a pop machine on our scheduled breaks.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lots of promises and goals that are very unrealistic.  Management has video cameras everywhere and monitors your computer continously.  Family run business.  Old School thoughts and not innovative anymore. Dying business.  Has a very dominant subculture around Religion in the office.  No one is allowed to even drink coffee.  Very Strange place to work.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop hiring friends and family and get some talent to move the company into the future.  Don't talk about warehouse jobs not leaving when your management says you are opening an office in China.</advice-to-management>
