“U-Save-It Pharmacy and it's employees”

</title><pros>Pros – I really took to all the customers really fast. They were all a joy to help when help was needed. The company is a good company to work for. The owner is a great guy and pays really well. He will praise you when you have done a job well done. The hours are wonderful open from 9 to 6 Monday thru Friday and 9 to 1 on Saturday in which you swap out the Saturdays that you work. He will listen to all complaints and try to solve all problems in his stores. If you have a problem with the pharmacist at your store he will have a meeting with the both of you to try and solve the problem right then.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I really can't not think of too many downsides except for some of the pharmacist in the stores are very hard to work for. For instance the one pharmacist I worked for at U-Save-It was just hateful at times. When I first started working with her you could tell she didn't like change and she didn't care for new people being hired in her store with out her doing the hiring. She had her favorites as all pharmacist do but she really showed it especially in front of the customers. If they would all just tell you sometimes what a great job you are doing instead of everthing being about what you are doing wrong it would be the best place to work in my eyes.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Im not real sure about Senior Management at U-Save-it, i don't believe they have that in their stores.</advice-to-management>
