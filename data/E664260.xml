“Loads of Opportunity!”

</title><pros>Pros – A traditional CPA firm, but with loads of opportunity to perform engagements across various services and to take on increased responsibilities.  Not pigeonholed into just tax or auditing.  Also, given way more responsibility out of the gate than I have had at subsequent firms I have worked for.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The firm is small with down time, so may be a little too slow for a hard charger type personality.  But, if looking for work/life balance for family or to pursue a graduate degree, it works out great!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Loved Mr. Johnson!  Thanks for the opportunities!</advice-to-management>
