“MSquared comes with contractor handling”

</title><pros>Pros – If you want or need a greater amount of support, then this may be perfect for you. There is continuous monitoring of your status at the client's site. Meetings with the MSquared manager, bi-weekly updates sent to MSquared, etc.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The degree of support can become micro-management. The manager I worked with at the client site was somewhat irritated by the frequency of contact by the MSquared manager.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Consider the level of contact needed at the client.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
