“Stay away!”

</title><pros>Pros – I would say that if you were contemplating working here....don't. Run in the opposite direction. While the owner seems pleasant at first, she can become downright mean. The only pleasant thing about this office was working with Bradford, the VP.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You aren't allowed to review things on social media (LinkedIn included!) and they have severely outdated methods of doing things with no room for suggestions or alternatives. There is no ATS, making candidate searches tedious. The owner has no trust in her employees and doesn't treat her employees very well. This place zaps the life out of you! The turn over rate here is insane (equal rates of termination and employees quitting)! Employee morale is low and it shows.</cons>
