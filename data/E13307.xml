“Professional firm but too centrally managed in HQ”

</title><pros>Pros – Well respected in the industry, especially in the compliance field. Detailed procedures written but unfotunately not appreciated by clients. Ethical company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – A very much top down management styled organization. Very conservative company. Cmparerd to the competitors, Connors not known to be pro-active in offering products with a 'wow' price. Focus is not right. Should be sourcing the future, not inspecting (QA) the future. Too QA focused.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There are many talents out in the offices. Reach out and listen. Corp powers are concentrated in too few senior executives.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
