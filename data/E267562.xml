<title>

“laid back atmosphere at George R Willy PC”

</title><pros>Pros – The file clerks had a lot of time to themselves. Lots of freedom was given. Friendly attorneys and legal assistants that bothered you very infrequently for things.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There was very little instruction from management. I was taught the specifics by the current file clerk, and had to teach the next file clerk. It was not a hard concept, though.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – No advice needed. The work environment was very productive, but maybe because I like to work alone. Keep up the good work</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
