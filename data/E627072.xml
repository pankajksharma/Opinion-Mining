“Unpaid Internship”

</title><pros>Pros – Great environmentFun place to workGreat Campaigns</pros>
<cons>Cons – Position is unpaidPresident admitted to not really looking to the interns as potential new hires.Small: Not necessarily a bad thing by any means but considering how small it is the interns seem to get overlooked way too much.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – A little bit more structure with the internship would be nice. Perhaps a greater focus on education instead of tossing them head first into the water. Still a lot of fun to work there though.</advice-to-management>
