<cons>Cons – Some employees are only there for their paychecks and do not always follow the rules.Gets very hot in the kitchen.Management does not always watch its words when speaking to employees.Located in a small town, so career opportunities can seem sparse if you are trapped in Northern Michigan.</cons>
