“Overall a Good Place to Work”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a very close-knit community and they are willing to bring new people in. They are very flexible with time off and understanding when things come up. They also do a pretty good job of communicating major changes or problems that come up.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is very low especially in comparison to working at a public school. You also should expect to work weekends (like any other teacher) and expect to be given extra responsibilities, either as part of your teaching duties or things which benefit the school or the parish. Often, problem students are not appropriately addressed especially after multiple warnings and disciplinary actions by the teacher and the administration. The school also admits students with special needs even though there is no framework with which to support those students. They have a basic remedial reading program but that's not enough for many of those students with special needs or behavior problems.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be stronger to parents and don't let them walk all over you. If the school increases in quality and has more rigorous standards, then the demand of high quality students will increase and you won't need to accept students who need more help than the school is able to offer them.</advice-to-management>
