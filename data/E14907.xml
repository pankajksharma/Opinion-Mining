“Buyer”

</title><pros>Pros – Fantastic ability to lead your own team and develop and create your own assortments. Fun to drive new business and see the results of your hard work</pros>
<cons>Cons – completely unappreciated for double digit growth. They would rather have computers to all the work than any talented people with the ability to think for themselvs.</cons>

“Don't Believe The Internal Surveys”

</title><pros>Pros – The offices are at the base of Big Cottonwood Canyon which means you're about 30 minutes from slapping your skis on when you get off work.Your performance doesn't seem to matter as long as you understand the politics of the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I felt like when taking a survey I was one of the few people answering honestly.  This company is staffed by passive aggressive types that are worried their criticism of the company in surveys could be tracked back to them.Upper Management is extremely reactive to market trends.  There's a whole division of the company dedicated to trend analysis and forecasting... Of course these people are ignored and/or fired because their advice, based on facts, counters the hunches and gut feelings of upper management.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Create a longterm strategy and follow it.  I understand the benefits of being nimble but attempting to correct course week by week is not a good strategy.  Identify your core business and grow it.  Work in your strengths rather than trying to pursue new businesses that someone else is already doing better.  Once you have a solid profit generating machine from your core that you can no longer improve then start looking at how to expand.Also, surround yourself with people that are smart and willing to present counter arguments to your ideas... Then, and this is the hard part, actually listen to them.</advice-to-management>

“Not perfect (no company is) but works hard to improve”

</title><pros>Pros – Some of the executives understand the company's cultural shortcomings and are working hard to improve it.  There is lots of opportunity for promotion for those who understand how to maneuver through the system and are willing to deliver high performance consistently.  There has been a consistent process in place for quite some time for delivering competitive pay and benefits and it is starting to pay off.  Employees who are patient and willing to personally contribute to improve the culture are much happier and productive than those who only focus on the growing pains.  Overstock has a bright future because the people who work here (including senior management) really care about making Overstock #1 in the industry.  By many measures it already is.  The tools and technology developed here are first rate.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The purpose of a company is to deliver superior value to the customer and other stakeholders.  Some executives seem to forget that employees are also stakeholders.  Conversely, some employees think a company exists only to make their lives better.  The two competing views have caused friction in the past, and like any company, will cause friction in the future.  My view is that the problems are simply a matter of growing pains.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Communicate to employees their role in delivering superior value to the customer comes first, and recognize that it takes a satisfied workforce to make that happen.  Be honest with employees about the primary mission but that you are also working hard to improve the culture over time.  Where things break down is when the words communicated don't match the actions taken.  Focus on communicating what makes Overstock a great company but be honest and acknowledge the internal flaws while taking positive steps to fix them.  SVPs should be conducting frequent and consistent stand ups to foster better two-way communication.  This is going to take some hard work but over time you will start to get more honest and open feedback rather than just hearing what you want to hear.  Perception is everything.</advice-to-management>

“Thoughtless, careless leaders. The worst I've seen.”

</title><pros>Pros – There's a lot of opportunity for learning and advancing yourself at this company; however, there is little "mentorship" or help. In order to succeed, you must be able to learn complex systems on your own.</pros>
<cons>Cons – To the review who stated, "some employees think a company exists only to make their lives better," shame on you. Every employee I worked with at this company WANTED Overstock.com to succeed, put in hours of effort and sweat, and have gone through the grinder to make Overstock.com what it is today. Your comment shows exactly what is wrong with this company.Here are some of the "cons" I witnessed throughout the years I worked for this company:- Random firing sprees. I witnessed one of 20+ people or more, none of whom were on a performance plan and had any reason to believe they would be fired.- Random firings. If you have a laptop in a meeting, or look at your cell phone (even if it's work-related) and an executive doesn't like it, you could be asked to leave the company at that moment.- "Trial and Error Promotions." When someone leaves the company, instead of hiring or promoting, Overstock will FORCE the responsibility on to someone, and not give them a pay increase or a title change. Several "managers" are doing the work of senior directors. One VP is particularly to blame for this, and claims that "we'll change things in February, when it's time for bonuses and raises." SHAME ON YOU.- Degradation of knowledge for internal systems, causing degradation of the company itself- Lack of overall strategy. This company is THE MOST REACTIVE you will ever work for, and you will NEVER be able to set a long-term strategy in place because of this. Don't even bother.- Politics and nepotism. Favorites are consistently promoted to the top, even if they lack the necessary skills to complete the job. This causes a VERY LOW moral and the "workers" to be unmotivated and careless.- A general lack of care for the employees by upper level management. Employees are looked upon as grunts that don't matter, forced to work unbelievably long hours for unbelievably NON-COMPETITIVE PAY.- The company was told every year, "the bonus pool is going to be great!" and every year, without fail, there is some excuse as to why the bonuses are bad. People will be told, "don't worry, it's worth it for the bonus!" by upper management, only to be shafted when it comes that time of year. Don't even count on a bonus.All in all, the leadership of the company is destroying the company, day by day. For years, they have said they will change, for years they have not. Don't expect things to change any time soon. This is not a place for a career.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get rid of the upper-level leaders who are selfishly looking out for themselves, driving out your valuable and ethical employees. The problem starts at the top, and needs to be fixed there as well. Stop ignoring the problem."What problem?"</advice-to-management>

“Patrick Byrne, the CEO, is a tyrant.”

</title><pros>Pros – I was able to do amazing work and to develop my skills.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The culture is horrible. It's real-life Yertle the Turtle. No one should work for Overstock.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You absolutely must get rid of Patrick Byrne. His bad ideas and practices have cost the company millions of dollars. O.co was a flop. His rule is oppressive. He promotes his mistress and those who will agree with him no matter what damage it causes. He carries guns through security at airports. Take a look at how many employees have left in the last year.</advice-to-management>

“Rapidly changing, ripe with opportunity, but only because top management is bi-polar and create an unstable work enviro.”

</title><pros>Pros – Laid back atmosphere, flexible. Has tremendous community values on some things. Excellent development team.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Upper management uses emotions and will often make decisions on things they do not understand. Moving ahead in the company more often is who you know, not how hard you work. Bonus system is next to nonexistent, unless you are an executive, and never transparent.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Trust the people you hire instead of having to be involved with every little decision. Quit paying yourselves so much and give it to the workers instead. This economy and country is being destroyed by those at the top of business. Quit adding to the problem, please.</advice-to-management>

“Learned a lot, Cost me a lot........”

</title><pros>Pros – They do promote from within, and allow you to find your niche within the company.  There is a great onboarding process for new employees, and an all around good group of people that work there. You get a lot of visibility into a lot of different processes around the company, and if you are in the right meeting, on the right day,  your opinion is usually listened to.  There are no limitations of the cross functionality of a position.</pros>
<cons>Cons – NEPOTISM.  If you are not in the IN crowd, you will wonder every day if you have a job.  Lots of emotionally run processes, with a lot of protection of the wrong people.  They want to 'help' you grow, as long as you do exactly as they want you to do, they leave that up to you to guess though, lots of changing minds depending on the mood. A lot of fear based management, it comes from the highest of the high, so its no wonder that it trickles down.</cons>

“Great people, great opportunities.”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock combines the fun and excitement of a start up without the long hours and worry of 'will they be around next month'.- Work/life balance is great- Plenty of opportunities to grow your career- Flex hours- Plenty of educational opportunities- Raises bases on performance- Team based culture, big egos don't last long here</pros>
<cons>Cons – - E-retail is seasonal, things get a bit chaotic going in Q4- A lot of projects aren't well defined and require IT to flush out the details to get it across the line.- The CEO, you love him or hate him</cons>

“Decent place to work...”

</title><pros>Pros – Interesting technology - the company is willing to invest in cutting edge stuff so you get to play with some really neat ecommerce solutions and tools.  Smart coworkers - there are a lot of brilliant people at the company.  You will have to weed through a few people just coasting along but most people there are working hard and know what they are doing.  Resume builder - its an impressive company to have on your resume if you want to work in IT, ecommerce, software dev, etc.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Pay - pay was a bit of a joke.  I started out at a very low wage, then with a reorg was given a VERY large pay increase (40% or so).  It seemed random and wasnt quite enough to keep me but was appreciated.  There were MBA grads coming in at <35k a year. Leadership focus - there are (were) some great leaders and they could motivate and bring the team together, however it seemed like there was an overall lack of vision and direction.  What vision there was was not always clearly articulated.</cons>

“Real Review ...”

</title><pros>Pros – Pay - it was quite good for me.Location - it is surrounded by beauty and located next to Big Cottonwood canyon.Flexibility - They are very understanding if you need time for appointments, family, errands, etc.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Healthcare - One of the worst I have had.Disorganization - it was the most unstructured and disorganized place I have ever worked.Hostility - I have never worked some place with so much internal anger, bullying, and competitiveness. This is the reason I left.Apathy - No one cared about the success of projects in a genuine and supportive way - but sometimes in a threatening way. No one cares about your happiness there. No one cares to lead.Hands tied - I have never worked somewhere with so many barriers and lack of assistance. They expected you to succeed and then don't empower you to do so. You are expected to take initiative and get through those barriers, which is fine and dandy, but then the same barriers exist for everyone on every project and they don't fix them. Other experts that can help you intentionally do not for whatever reason (for me I was told it was because of time constraints and in one case it was just because the person didn't want to because he said he didn't care).Negativity - The attitude of the people I worked with was sarcasm, criticism, condescension, elitism, disgust, and apathy.Escape Artists - there were quite a few people that dodged work in any way they could and they were not reprimanded. They flew under the radar and honestly did less work in a year than others did in weeks.No Leadership - I had four different managers/supervisors/directors in my short time there and they all quit. There was a period of time I had no manager 1 or even 2 levels above me where there were positions open. I had very little direction, guidance, or support. Actually I was never even really sure who I reported to. Where there are leaders higher up (executives), they seemed completely oblivious to how we were using their time and money.Fear - Another reason I left was that I felt someone who was a tyrant got into a position of power and people feared even being in the same room as that person because they might get fired if they did anything to displease them. Personally, I had to deal with the fear of getting into yelling, hollering, and threatening situations. Some these were very close to physical. There was lots of cussing, swearing, and physical intimidation (fist pounding, people getting right in your face, throwing things etc.).Lack of Structure - I was never really officially on any team. Software development there is very agile, self managed, and fluid. I think being this way is good to a certain extent, but there needs to be good direction, decisions, and some framework of ideas in place in order to achieve some business goal. It is really chaos when large egos with different ideas are constantly battling each other and no leader creates resolution. There really needs to be better structure and flow there when and where self management is failing - but no one ever seems to notice or care.They created one of the worst experiences in my life for me, and the worst part about it is, even though I brought it up with my coworkers and various superiors, no one ever tried to fix it and they didn't seem to care. I think it is because no one wants to make waves and they don't care - they would rather just quit as all my superiors did. The place needs a major overhaul or to be demolished.One other note - I think the company is going to do well financially for a while, but eventually it will explode from the middle out unless they fix the major issues I have listed. I think there is lots of wiggle room for mistakes and they will still make profits, but eventually they will exhaust all the talent in the area no matter how much they pay and then things will dwindle. There is still time to recover I think, but I will never work there again - I would rather be dead than sacrifice my integrity that way. They don't deserve my time after how I was treated and how they treat each other and themselves. It literally makes me sick to my stomach to think about the waste of potential and money there. Some people might say, why not help to try and fix it, then I consider the fact that I am not immortal and there are other companies that already have much, much better culture, work environment, and employees.I can't think of a reason why I would recommend this company to anyone for employment, but if you talk with someone else from the company, you might get a completely different response because of the internal disparity. Again - why risk it, go somewhere else in my opinion.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Are you kidding? Pay attention. Control the apathy and people taking advantage of the company. Kill the aggression and hostility if you want to keep employees - but I never got the impression that you cared any way, so I doubt you will listen. Foster a community of cooperation rather than internal competitiveness. Stop being so oblivious to the well being of the teams. You keep losing people, but don't care why and then just dish out more money as if that will make up for things and get more talent. Money doesn't matter at a certain point. If you want to attract and keep people, think about the internal environment and make it a place where people will want to be and feel empowered to succeed. What a mess.Because Glassdoor doesn't have a box for general comments, I guess I will put them here:The company is large enough that if you talk with someone on Team A they love it and someone on Team H they hate it. There are lots of good and bad reviews on Glassdoor and I think that is the reason why. The company is very chaotic and inconsistent. Unless they do something to get involved and understand themselves better, they will wax and wane in the market.Personally I looked at the reviews before I stared there and thought well - they are mostly favorable with some nightmarish ones peppered in. Whatever Overstock can dish out, I will handle it and it will make me stronger. I am glad I experienced it so now I have another point of reference data, but I can save you some time and anguish and let you know that if you do happen to land in one of the bad pockets, you will be miserable. But who knows you might get lucky and end up in a good team/department. I suppose you could take a shot and then look for another job if didn't work out.</advice-to-management>

“Excellent technology company that sells things while developing and valuing their employees.”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com treats you like an adult. They understand that people make mistakes and deal with that professionally and develop people to become better employees. Thus making the whole company better.</pros>

“Its OK , not Great”

</title><pros>Pros – The environment is laid back and the work environment is quite casual. People get the things done and I believe that is what management cares about.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Too much bureaucrat management, the projects do not just kickstart. Lot of promises but no results. because of the planned projects, they do recruit resources and then nothing. People run away and the company has attrition issues. And when you resign from company, they are so much worried about the relocation bonus that they paid. To recover the money, they have attorney at the exit interview to intimidate the employee and threaten them with confiscating car if money is not returned. This talks a lot of about culture and values of the company.</cons>

“Work here is my happy place”

</title><pros>Pros – Note: I would have given a 5-star rating if I hadn't read the 2 most recent customer care/customer service reviews first. Part of why I was proud to work at Overstock when I started was that a friend who'd worked in customer care had raved about it, but it seems like that's changed:"The Team Leads monitor everyone’s phone to see who is not available to take calls, and walk around the floor yelling at agents so loud the customers can hear them. Agents are expected to respond to customer emails AND talk to customers while resolving their issues at the same time! We are monitored for the amount of minutes spent in “Bathroom Break”, and are discouraged from using the restroom except during our normal Break or Lunch time."I am horrified to hear about this mistreatment of workers whose jobs are already brutal and low-paying. When I hear someone making 90k+ with plenty of job opportunities elsewhere complaining, I don't care that much. But degrading people like this? And employees who are already less privileged? Not okay.=====That said, Overstock has been good to me. I started in IT with few usable skills, my first job out of college, and I'm happier than I ever have been in my life.I find the work to be collaborative, both within my close-knit dev team and the other teams, in and out of IT, that we work with. Many of the coworkers I've worked most closely with have been promoted, and/or transferred to a position that closer matches want they want to work on.My team doesn't currently face any deadline pressure to speak of, that I know about, and we determine what we'll be working on to a significant degree. We have a lot of impromptu conversations about features.How we work is also flexible--I have spent time just learning, programming on my own with mentor oversight, pair-programming, and programming on my own without oversight.I have a sitting-to-standing desk, most people come in around 9am but later is okay, offsite is okay (but unusual--a pro for me since I prefer to be able to ask people questions and raise concerns or ideas), last-minute PTO is okay.In addition to core Java, I have the opportunity to work with diverse technologies, old and up-and-coming.The location looks like a state park, with a beautiful nature trail and stream running behind the building, with gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains. The people are friendly and smart and the environment's small enough that you're always around familiar faces. On Halloween, we had a costume party and trick-or-treating for workers' kids. We've had 2 Hackathons (24-hour programming competitions in which teams try to implement an idea they had with the most business value and innovation) in the last year, one internal tech conference, and one inevitable Harlem shake video. Attire is more-or-less jeans, t-shirt, and plaid button-up, sitting on desks or beanbags commonplace for some teams.Benefits are good. Some people are complaining about the soon-to-be-mandatory switch to the High Deductible Healthcare Plan, but I chose that over the previous plan because it was a better choice given my level of healthcare costs.</pros>
<cons>Cons – What people say about sudden shifts in direction is absolutely true. I've learned to ride it out, but it's definitely harmed my ability to think of Overstock as a long-term employment opportunity. Things change so quickly that my employment status could be one of them. (Though I do hope to stay here  and continue to enjoy it for years to come).These shifts have affected my team both because talent has suddenly been pulled off to other projects, hurting the team dynamics as well as reducing our resources, and to a lesser extent through a wavering commitment to improving existing projects. I don't pretend to know enough about business to judge the soundness of these decisions for Overstock overall.Changes also often occur and either aren't announced (as in the case of many promotions I've learned about from the grapevine) or aren't clear. This causes some confusion, although again I'm not sure about the relative merits of letting organizational structure evolve organically vs. planning it out in detail and attempting to impose it on the organization.Overstock also has a serious corporate rumor mill, with a lot of negativity that honestly has a bigger impact on my job satisfaction than whatever it is people happen to be complaining about. This may well simply indicate that I'm lucky. At least I'm not one of those poor devs who's been moved out to the extremely less-scenic Warehouse location.</cons>

“Always looking ahead, existing business secondary”

</title><pros>Pros – Developers get opportunities to do software engineering on a regular basis.  Most development teams still have the proverbial 80% maintenance, 20% new code split.Developers can get a lot of opportunities to interact with the business owners.  Dev leads are usually very open to sharing requirements gathering, etc., with developers.You can have direct access to the people who staff the Network Operations Center, to the software architecture team, to the project (business) owners, and management.  The organization is very good about sharing information if you ask (there aren't a lot of fiefdoms).We regularly (if slowly) incorporate new frameworks and technologies into our development environment.  You can have a company-wide impact.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This has been the busiest, most engaging place in which I've ever worked, but I know other people on other teams don't have that experience.  The reason I've been busy lately is that most of my team was moved to new project teams, leaving two people to continue development on a schedule designed for six people.  The focus on new-new-new projects and the disconcerting tendency to move 50% of the IT staff to the current hot project means older software may be neglected for years, until the business, CSRs, or the partners scream loudly and often enough to get someone (or some team) tasked with implementing a hurried fix.It's tough to recruit full-time employees to the company because it's in Salt Lake City.  A lot of people don't want to move to the "middle of nowhere" and don't want to be paid below market-leading wages.  When I was hired, Overstock claimed to pay top dollar for developers in the Salt Lake Valley but can't compete in 2013 when other companies (like Goldman Sachs) offer 20% more.Your success, promotions, raises, etc., are tied to how much your dev lead and director like you.  That's true everywhere but it's disappointing that low-level managers don't get better training in evaluation and coaching and that some dev leads are kept in positions they're ill-suited to fill.  With the recent (announced April 2013) changes to the IT organization management structure some of these problems may begin to be alleviated.  Promotions to new positions (not just a title) are uncommon and are based on popularity, so if you're looking to move up you'll need to practice your politics.The company is rapidly building out office space in their SLC warehouse/call center location and relocating development and business teams there.  With the bifurcated company Presidency (one based in Cottonwood Heights, one based in West Valley) a lot of teams are being moved "voluntarily."  (Seriously?  Would you say no?)  This has been unpopular with people who chose to live near Cottonwood Heights to be close to work.I feel like the IT organization is not longer committed to learning, developing employees, and improvement, all characteristics that attracted me to the position in the first place.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Focus on metrics and the ROI.  I believe it's important to grow the business and explore new directions, but don't neglect existing business to do so.  Focus on the company's core competencies and don't offshore or outsource work that is key to maintaining (or slowly growing) revenue.  Stop throwing waves of people at projects, go read _The Mythical Man Month_ and go take a refresher on Agile development:  projects and development are broken because we're not creating trust between the business owners, dev leads, and directors.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – Pet projects seem to be given higher priority than mission critical projects. Management politics are a bit too much.

</title><pros>Pros – There are some really talented people in the Director, Sr. Manager roles. Some days of work are normal and business is doing well (online retail that is).</pros>
<cons>Cons – Executives are poor leaders. After firing the CFO, CMO, and many key non-c-suite leaders, there is little chance this organization is poised for growth. People are fired all the time with no explanation and often there role is taken over by the person that fired them. The constant struggle for power among the execs leaves everyone at risk of being collateral damage. You can find a better job elsewhere.</cons>

<cons>Cons – The largest downside it the current Excessive Management Team. They are running the place like it is a High School popularity contest. If your in with the Execs then your good as gold.

</title><pros>Pros – not really any pro's to working here</pros>
<cons>Cons – They can't manage their call volume so they have put almost everyone on the phone so you can't get the help that you need when you need it. Causing the customers to get upset. They don't care how abusive customers are they just make you deal with it because of their own stupid policies. By not getting the help needed you can't advance because nobody cares about your development or even trying to help you. If you don't hit the ground running eventually they terminate you. They change the rules without telling you and then you get in trouble for nor abiding by the rules. If by chance you do advance you either are related or sleeping with somebody. At one time I heard it was a good company to work for but oh how the mighty have fallen.</cons>

“It started out good and has slowly spiraled into a nightmare.”

</title><pros>Pros – Opportunities for growth – if you have the right connections.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This used to be a decent place to work, but has turned into a nightmare. If you are looking for a Customer Service position, don’t apply here unless you are desperate and haven’t been able to find work anywhere else. At one time the work environment was very laid back and easy going, but in the last year that has changed. The Team Leads monitor everyone’s phone to see who is not available to take calls, and walk around the floor yelling at agents so loud the customers can hear them. Agents are expected to respond to customer emails AND talk to customers while resolving their issues at the same time! We are monitored for the amount of minutes spent in “Bathroom Break”, and are discouraged from using the restroom except during our normal Break or Lunch time. Agents have become micromanaged to the point of being ridiculous. EVERYTHING is monitored and recorded except for the amount of air we breathe while we talk.There are quite a few specialty teams to apply for advancement to, but forget about being accepted for a position, unless you are best friends with or related to someone on one of those teams. If you have a medical condition and have FMLA approval, don’t ever miss work due to your condition, otherwise you will never be advanced to another team/department. Don’t ever complain or report any concerns to Human Resource, they are self admitted gossipers and you do not want to get on their bad side.The beginning of January 2014 the health insurance will be increasing to an HSA account with a high deductable, including prescriptions.Needless to say, there is a very high turnover rate here. I get home from work and right away check the job boards. This job has turned me into a nervous wreck and I actually have bad dreams about my job. The pay and the benefits are a joke considering what the employees have to put up with. If you like dealing with customers and supervisors yelling at you all day long, being micromanaged, cranking out emails and phone calls simultaneously all day long, and feeling like crying as soon as you get in your car, all for low pay and pitiful benefits, then this must be your dream job. I have worked in Call centers for over 20 years, and after working here, I never want to work in another Call center environment again.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – The pay is okay. Pick and Pack starts at 10.00 and Stock Control starts at 13.00. If you like excercise this is a great job for that. Lots of walking, bending, streching, and lifting. As well as standing in one place while packing. Can meet a few great people to work with and for.</pros>
<cons>Cons – HUGE turn over. May not get full time hours until 4th quarter which runs from Oct. or Nov. through Dec. or Jan. Supervisor always telling you what a great job your doing, but can turn around with in minutes and tell you they can't help you keep your job if you don't do better. IF you get the chance to advance don't be surprised if you only get training towards half your job because they keep pulling you away from it to do your old job. The training you do receive is only partial. Their idea of teaching you how to pack is to put you at a packing station and tell you to put the item in the smallest box it will fit in without damaging the box and send it down the line. Then they bring the box back to you and tell you that you need a bigger box. You might trade boxes and get it back again and they tell you the box is to big. It can be very confusing. They change the way items get packed at least once a week, but don't tell you about it so you end up with an error. NO ONE is on the same page.</cons>

“Sweet Bitter”

</title><pros>Pros – Company moves at a fast pace and you will be able to acquire some great experience with a fairly big player in e-commerce.   The company acquires many good, intelligent people at HQ and is always seeking new, "outside-the-box" idea generators.   The company encourages hard work and tends to compensate at market levels (salary not bonus).</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company claims to project a culture of honesty and integrity, but I believe the exact opposite is true.   Conflicting direction abounds.  So-called company policies are executed on an arbitrary basis.  A verbal commitment/promise from a SVP/VP means absolutely nothing.   Paranoia prevails as non-compete agreements are part of the company's mission statement.SVP's & VP's are very egotistical, incompetent, and strong political machines.  Only the CEO and CFO have any foresight into discovering and supporting new ideas and talent.  No one can challenge any directive, opinion, or position of any SVP/VP as they will be punished (e.g. demoted, passed over for promotion, or fired, etc.).  Manage by intimidation is the company's mantra.</cons>

“Earning my loyalty every day”

</title><pros>Pros – To me, atmosphere is everything.  Every job in IT is going to come with certain common traits.  But the environment that Overstock sets makes it easy to come to work everyday.  While Overstock had some rocky times from 2005-2009, things are much better now.  The executives are smart and know what it takes to do your job, because it was probably their job before they got promoted.  The management team is very conscious of the work/life balance.  Their motto is definitely "Work Hard - Play Hard".  Have I worked long hours?  Of course.  However, I've also been told to take extra paid days off to compensate.  Overstock understands that you have a life outside the office and that sometimes that takes priority.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There are not too many negatives about working at Overstock.  The execs have worked very hard to filter out anyone that consistently causes "office drama", but some still exists.  It's certainly much less than other places I've worked.  The biggest "con" is a side-effect of this being a great place to work, i.e. no one wants to leave.  Moving up can be difficult because people like where they are.  Luckily, Overstock always try to fill positions from within before hiring outside the company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Overstock does seem to have an obsession with catering every event with Cafe Rio.  Now, I love Cafe Rio, but can we get Zupas from time to time?  Maybe even Chinese?</advice-to-management>

“Improving workplace; lack of roadmap from senior executives”

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible work hours; don't really have to work as hard as you might for others in the industry; good people to work with; improving direction from senior executives (i.e., recent lack of non-sensical, herky-jerky, unfounded and disastrous strategic shifts); great place to cut your teeth in certain departments as a springboard to elsewhere; great Customer Service (let's hope so, given how much it costs the company); agile when direction is set and communicated.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Non-sensical, herky-jerky, unfounded and disastrous strategic shifts from senior executives; virtually no ROI projections done for strategic projects, and certainly no standard office that would consistently perform these estimates; lip service paid to defending company's profitable stores while limited resources are siphoned off to pet projects; pay pegged to geography, rather than to a position for an increasingly transitory e-commerce space; internal tools and systems developed to better train and manage human capital, but are rarely used and miss the most useful goal of training managers.</cons>

“A good Short Term gig”

</title><pros>Pros – Pretty laid back work environment.

They have some fun company activities and other morale boosting activities on a pretty regular basis. The people who work here are awesome!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Job can be mundane and boring. Editors are given very little responsibility besides dropping out background and uploading images to the website. The worst part is that they pay the photo team very little based on the skill set requirements and raises are so hard to come by.

<cons>Cons – I have worked at Overstock.com for almost 4 years now. Every year I keep hoping for a cost of living pay increase at least. But, I don't get one and, I am not the only one.

“Exceptional Downhill Slide In Past 2 Years”

</title><pros>Pros – - Culture- Close Involvement to Major E-commerce Projects- Resume Builder- Work Close with Executives- LocationThis review a few years ago would have been much different. It WAS a very positive place to work, but that was long ago.</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Senior Management- Dejected Workforce- Recent Braindrain- Wishy Washy Decision Making on Projects Causing Incredible Expense and Dissatisfaction by Those Working Hard Only To See No Fruit From Their Labor- Lack of DirectionThe decisions around company direction and project focus are very scattered. No two executives could tell you similarly what the direction of the company is. Projects are reactionary to what other sites already do, not innovative by any means. An amazing amount of resources and money are put into projects that are not thought through, resulting in complete stoppage of a project only to move on to something similarly thought through.Prices and quality of merchandise are poor, which is what the company should be working to improve, instead of looking to do everything it can as fast as it can. Instead of focusing on core values and a standard business model, anything and everything are brought to the table and pushed.The number of people with deep Overstock knowledge combined with industry experience and intelligence leaving Overstock is kind of staggering. I want to say it is due to firings (which have occurred often since mid 2011) but the truth is most are leaving on their own because they see a sinking ship. Confidence among workers is at an all time low. Per their own stated results, the only reason O.co made a profit in Q1 2012 is because overhead/workforce was diminished so severely.Unless significant change to senior management occurs, I fear this company is not going to survive or will become a shell of its former self. This is an opinion I've heard directly from internal employees including from multiple at the VP level. The board needs to require a change in action instead of letting the chairman and other SVPs run rampant.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to those that know processes. Slow down and figure out where you want to be as a company in 5 years, 10 years, etc. Stop wasting so much business and development time and money with pet projects that don't fit into an intelligent business plan.</advice-to-management>

“Life was good in IT, but the company may be headed downhill”

</title><pros>Pros – Developers get to spend a fairly large percentage of their time doing development and related tasks. Meetings are minimal if you’re in IT and not a manager. I probably averaged 1-2 meetings a week. Day-to-day life as a developer is pretty good.Management seems to understand that technology is a key part of the business, and IT is treated well. I experienced little pressure to meet deadlines; when something changed, we either removed some functionality or pushed the deadline back.Developers do not have on call responsibilities. The Network Operations Center takes care of operational issues and they are the ones who get paged. Occasionally I had to stay up until around midnight for a major deploy my team was involved in, but you can do this from home.IT management cares about code quality, in particular the codebase for the main website. They also care about keeping somewhat up-to-date on current technologies. Developers and testers can join once-a-week lunchtime reading groups about technology subjects that may or may not be directly related to their everyday jobs.Most people are smart and reasonably good at what they do.Nice location near the Wasatch mountains and very close to I-215.Work/life balance was great. I rarely had to put in any extra time, and when I did I could come in late the next day. Some departments, especially IT, have flexible schedules.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Upper management seems to have taken a real dive lately. Some of their decisions leave lower-level employees scratching their heads. The most recent example is the “O.co” rebranding. A majority of customers, after seeing a commercial about the new O.co name, tried to go to “o.com” instead of “o.co”. Any person at my level could have told management this would happen, if they had bothered to ask. Lack of confidence in executives has led to a general feeling of instability, culminating in the laying off of about 50 people, most in IT, just last week. The Provo development office was also closed after being open only about a year, and people who were hired expecting to work most of the time out of Provo are now stuck with a long commute.Financial results have been disappointing the last few quarters. As part of the financial rebalancing that happened at the beginning of the year, most of the employee perks were cut: parking shuttle, holiday party, and conference budget.Work areas are pretty crowded, and many people don’t have cubicles.Life is not very good for some development leads. Instead of being a technical leadership position, dev leads really end up spending most of their time managing people, coordinating projects, and going to meetings. For those that would like to stay technical and still spend time every day writing code, this is frustrating.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop worrying about whether Wall Street is illegally driving down the price of your shares, and instead focus on getting Overstock back on its feet. Pay your people what they’re worth, or they will find another company who will.</advice-to-management>

“Always shifting like sand dunes”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com is recognized (by our partners) as being a MORE professional environment, than many other online retailers. The benefits package is fair, and Salt Lake City is a great place to live and work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There are some very basic retail functionalities that are absent from the site, like the ability to price by option. Overstock has the resources and employee talent to become a game changer, but senior management doesn't seem to rally the troops towards those kinds of focused objectives. Overstock seems to be a couple steps behind competitors sites in terms of functionality and vision.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Drop the vacations, cars, insurance and O.Biz. Dedicate all efforts towards redesigning the site, updating the product view page and leading the charge in terms of "shop-ability" with things like price by option, better product images, etc.</advice-to-management>

“Very frustrating place to work, they are headed for a crash”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock generally hires smart people that are nice to work with. The location is very nice and composition is on standard with nation and generous for Utah.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Overstock has been one of the most frustrating places to do software development. I have heard software development at Overstock described as 'Mob Architecture' and cowboy development. You can literally be writing code and have someone else change it the next day and not talk to you at all (but its ok because they talked to Arch). Their biggest code base is their Shopping Site and it is a complete disaster. It is like no one thought at all about where to put code, who should maintain it and most code is placed where ever 'it just works'. When new projects are implemented usually little thought is put in place to design, but just what is quickest.The Architecture group mainly focuses on writing 'frameworks' that wrap just about every open source project they use (hibernate, jersey etc) in what I consider mostly fluff and unneeded abstractions of the true underlying framework. Overstock has created their own JSP like framework and their own dependency injection framework as well. They don't adhere to many basic pragmatic design choices (such as write once) maintaining many different internal libraries for model code that map the exact same behavior in a different library. Applications sometimes share the same table structure and communicate through database changes. They even have a reporting structure that tells the applications what to do through the database, there is no clear authority when it comes to data management. Communication between architecture and the teams varies quite a bit, depending on which person in Arch your working with (they don't communicate with each other either).Development teams are organized according to how the Business is organized, which on the surface works. But in reality leaves the development team vulnerable to the creativity of the senior management around the business entity. If you work for a Product Owner that lacks vision get ready for some uninteresting work (just do what X e-commerce site has already done), and potentially left for layoffs when push comes to shove. What the team works on is not collaborative at all. It is more like a hand me down of project work that is approved by senior management and left for the team to be excited about. When it fails that team is gone and the senior management chalks it up to a bad year. This recently happened when Overstock let go of 25% of it Developers and Testers, but not one senior management was affected even though it was widely known of some poor marketing decisions at the senior level brought about the bad year. And this was after they just hired quite a few individuals just 3 months previous!Overall I would avoid working for Overstock. Senior management doesn't allow for creativity on the team level. Domain ownership on a team level is almost nil. Company is headed for some rough times financially unless they start innovating!</cons>

“Company has Strong Potential for Growth but Weighed Down by Terrible Senior Management”

</title><pros>Pros – The Corporate Office is in a great location. There are scenic views of the Wasatch Mountains from the building with great hiking and skiing just a short drive away.PTO is given when needed. The company does a good job respecting the personal lives of the employees. I’ve never had trouble taking time off, even on short notice.The IT departments in the company do promote based on experience and you can be rewarded for hard work when positions above you become available.The company has a fairly loose internet policy and you are allowed to use YouTube or view other websites in your downtime. This has the potential for abuse, but very few websites are actually blocked from employees.Many midlevel managers are friendly and care about their employees and the quality of the work environment within their departments. They have limited power to solve problems but they will listen to your concerns.Overstock supports artisans from around the world by promoting their goods through the Worldstock program.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The CEO believes employees will work better when there is no barrier to communication. In most departments, this means that desks are crammed together back to back and side to side with no cubicle walls or privacy of any kind. In some areas there are over 100 employees in a single room. Employee screens are visible to anyone who cares to look. The open air workplace is incredibly noisy and distracting with no barriers to overhearing nearby phone calls, conversations, or meetings. This environment is a huge detriment to productivity.Overstock spends a lot of time on side businesses such as selling cars, vacations, or insurance which are often added to the business plan only to be cancelled shortly thereafter. The problem is not that these are terrible ideas but that they are poorly planned and not properly supported once implemented. Once started, the focus quickly shifts to the next big idea leaving the last one to flounder until it is quietly killed and removed from the website. While these side projects don’t affect the jobs of most employees, they are expensive to implement which directly affects the amount of money in the bonus and raise pool. Some of the recent projects cost millions of dollars yet were cancelled before even appearing on the website.The CEO and the SVPs have far too much power to push through projects in the company. If one of the executives has an idea, it will be implemented without being seriously vetted. Employees with expertise in their field are routinely ignored in favor of gut hunches from the executives. Those who suggest that an idea might not be in the best interest of the company usually do not last long, sometimes leaving of their own accord but oftentimes fired for some small offense. The fear of vindictive reprisals results in employees just doing what they are told to do without offering any suggestions, regardless of any knowledge that could improve the project.Overstock suffers from nepotism, with many managers, directors, and especially SVPs promoted based on how well they are liked rather than their experience. This has resulted in some exceptionally inept management. Because most of the SVPs have no prior executive experience, they continue to manage as if they were still team leads. Executive micromanagement of projects is a rampant problem throughout the company. It is not at all uncommon for SVPs or even the CEO to assign projects directly to an employee, often with unrealistic deadlines and no regard for whether that project even relates to the employee’s work responsibilities.Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the senior management at Overstock does not value the input of its workforce. Employees have been repeatedly told to keep constructive criticism to themselves, especially if it relates to a project that an executive is involved with. Employees who offer opinions, regardless of how well supported they may be, are usually removed from working on the project and sometimes fired. Employees are scared to give honest feedback and instead resort to giving false praise to obviously doomed projects to preserve their jobs. This causes many projects that could have been saved (or killed if warranted) in the early stages to fail after deployment.There are also a wide variety of subjects employees are repeatedly told not to ever discuss in any way, including the stock price (due to the CEO’s belief that outside forces are manipulating it to make it appear less valuable), lawsuits against the CEO or company, criticism of the CEO’s website deepcapture.com, or complaints about the CEO’s attack dog walking unleashed around the building and frightening employees. Occasionally a new employee will unknowingly mention one of these subjects and will be quickly told never to do so again.Most employees that I’ve spoken with view the company as a resume builder but not as a place for long term employment. The average turn over time is very short with employees of as little as two or three years being viewed as the seasoned workforce. Most employees leave within 18 months, even on the VP level. There have been 15 VPs in the marketing department alone over the last four years. This volatility results in a lack of overall focus as each VP has had a different view of the direction the department should follow. Employees are often shifted around between teams that need more people to support the new VP’s vision with little regard to the employee’s skill. Within six months of their hiring dates, most employees have changed desks and teams more than once, usually without any change in compensation. In addition to the volatility, there is little incentive for employees to stay as tenure does not come with increases to salary or PTO allotment and the company’s 401k matching policy is so poor that departing employees lose very little by not waiting to become fully vested. I would not recommend Overstock as a good place to work.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The executive micromanagement and nepotism need to stop. They are causing the company’s potential growth to stagnate at best and are contributing to a decline at worst. Rather than promoting the employees that are the most fun to party with, hire people that have expertise in their fields and then actually listen to and follow their advice rather than your own uninformed gut feelings. There are good ideas from within the workforce. Listen to what employees have to say and don’t view constructive criticism as hostile.Stop spending money on side businesses unless there is an actual plan in place to bring them to success. We are not an insurance company and unless we plan on hiring some employees who know anything about running an insurance company, we should probably stop trying to sell insurance. The employees work hard and deserve to be rewarded for their efforts and it is incredibly frustrating to us to not receive bonuses or raises due to the budget shortfalls caused by the failures of expensive projects that are far outside of the company’s core competency. We are great at selling bed, bath, and garden items. Let’s focus on expanding that and stop trying to be a real estate company, car dealership, insurance broker, and travel agency unless we’re prepared to support those areas with knowledgeable employees.</advice-to-management>

“It's been an interesting roller-coaster ride”

</title><pros>Pros – Some of the Management team here are among the most highly respected people I know.I feel I always know where I stand with my manager, any problems I have can be brought up objectively and corrected quickly, this even extends to my boss's bosses: It's really nice working with people you can trust to make the right decisions in a timely fashion.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There are some departments that are disconnected with the others; there are some major communications break-downs  that occur every once in a while (and one case where there is too much communication between individuals, this is more of a lapse in professionalism on the part of the Rep than the associate, there appears to be a downgrade in the quality of services he provides). I believe this can be traced back to specific individuals, however, there are usually other subordinates ready to take up the slack so day-to-day performance has rarely been impacted.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The issues detailed above seem to be in the stages of being addressed; Any advice I could offer would fall under the category of, "Stuff I Already Know".The Management team remains one of the most approachable groups of individuals I have encountered, they provide positive feedback and understandable critiques. I feel my work is recognized by my manager, by other managers and by their bosses; the praise and incentives provided (catered work parties for Mardi Gras [complete with parade and improvised floats?!], Cinco De Mayo , Independence Day, etc...) for quality work have been pretty steady and it still never ceases to amaze me how appreciated I feel at O.co.</advice-to-management>

“I feel that O.co is a great place to work and also a great contributor our local, national and global community.”

</title><pros>Pros – It is not just a job.  It is a community of people that do amazing things like (1) donated 80 thousand pounds of food to 2010 holiday food drive in Salt Lake City, (2) along with our amazing customers, provided Wounded Warrior Project with hundreds of thousands of dollars of support in 2010 and 2011; (3) through Worldstock, have provided about $70 million in funds to aritsans in developing economies over the past 10 years.  So I feel like my time at work counts for more than just putting money in my pocket.</pros>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Tough times calls for desperate measures.  It's not always easy making the hard decisions.

I believe that management is a strong group of people just trying to do the right thing for the company.  Rather than just shooting down ideas because you feel like something won't work, try it first if there is no good reason not to.  If it fails, then at least it was tried.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com is an example of how poor management affects sound business models”

</title><pros>Pros – Great work/life balanceSalt Lake is a nice place to liveLot of tech resources available, fundamental business is soundPretty healthy gross margins and top line growth is impressive</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very poor upper managementMiddle management is inexperiencedHorrendous expense managementAlmost all of the gross margin is lost due to irrational operating, marketing and G&A expensesOrganizations are redistributed too often, business strategies are transient and shakyNo strategic vision whatsoever, company has an identity crisis</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There is a stark contrast in Overstock's management team. If you were to draw a line down the middle, you would see a group of bright, ambitious go-getters on one side and a group of execs with no real experience outside O.co on the other. Product innovation is virtually stagnant and capital management is poor. Overstock's story reads like a b-school case study of a company with sound fundamentals that's handcuffed by poor management.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – - Growing Company- Profitable- Work/life balance- Smart peers- Ability to do solve very complex problems</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Senior Management very reactionary when making decisions- Not allowed to do things the right way, have to do what Senior Mgmt wants- Many of the leaders only have work experience at Overstock; not enough to know industry standards and best practices- Senior Management is over departments they should never even be allowed to get close to. (i.e. SVP of Customer Service also over Marketing)</cons>

“Below average experience with hefty bureaucracy”

</title><pros>Pros – Nice coworkers and one of the better views.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The bureaucracy is insane.  You practically have to get your hands stamped everytime you lift a finger to do something.  Senior management is getting better, but it feels like only a handful are qualified to run a billion dollar business.Internal supporting technology is at least 10 years behind, and there is a tendency to just pay the most expensive bidder to make a problem go away.Most of the qualified merchandising talent  has left in the past year.  Most businesses are run by recently promoted lower level employees trying to not screw it up too badly.  Everyone is scared to death of layoffs, which happen with no rhyme or reason.  Did I mention the bonus structure is nearly non-existent?</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Fix your reviews process.  It is pathetic.  Everyone is afraid of more qualified employees taking their place.  Low performers are given low goals that any baboon can reach, but high perfomers are given impossible goals to keep them in their place.Hire better.  With good talent, you don't have to have pay a bunch of number crunchers and consultants to tell you how to run the business.Senior management spends zero time at ground level.  The occasional 15 second hello in the hallway is useless.  Middle level employees are at the mercy of the the kings and queens of their fiefdoms.  There is no safe way to bubble up concerns privately.Spend one day a month sitting with employees, privately and at their desks   You'll learn a lot more than you ever will talking to other management.Stop jumping on the next big thing every month.  We need to get it right the first time.  Non-stop training for processes that change every quarter kills productivity.</advice-to-management>

“poor pay, micromanaging, poor communication”

</title><pros>Pros – easy to take time off, daily food trucks, great co-workers</pros>
<cons>Cons – promotions are given randomly to those not exactly qualified, while passing up long-term hard working employees. management seems removed from lower-rung workers and doesn't understand what exactly people do. few incentives, little praise when doing well but swift when someone makes a mistake. the feeling of being monitored constantly (online and offline); not being treated like adults. The benefits are also pretty expensive and terrible (Select Health - I had an HSA - I paid $30 a month, deposited $50 a month with no monthly employer contribution)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – give more advancement opportunities to those who have been there longer/worked hard, rather than hiring new, incompetent managers. give more monetary incentives (as opposed to embarrassing field-trip-esque 'concerts'). Monthly contributions to those with HSAs (customary at many smaller companies). Don't send out emails warning staff of spending "up to 15 minutes a day" on non-work sites - we are adults and we have BREAK TIME. Seriously, we can do our jobs too.</advice-to-management>

“Best job I've ever had.”

</title><pros>Pros – Going from working at Smith's food and drug to working at Overstock.com, I really must say Overstock is truly amazing! They provide you with all of the tools and resources you need to assist your customers, and allow you to do so. They are not limiting, and are sure to make it clear that your job is to advocate for the customer and make them happy. Making people happy is a job I like to do, and surely makes a job a lot easier.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the days surely become repetitive. Things may get old, but there is enough room for opportunity that once things really begin to become too repetitive you can move up or move teams or do something different, its amazing. The only thing I can say I really am not super impressed by is the quality scoring system. Such a little thing can totally blow the whole score.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Provide more ways to recognize agents when they do a good job.

“Great company Gone horribly WRONG”

</title><pros>Pros – Health benefits are OKIt is a great place if you are a ski bum or if you like hiking the state of Utah, or simply because you have a higher reason not to leave the state of Utah.If you are good at selling ideas that sound good in meetings and love to have meetings from 8am to 6pm, this is the place for you. If you are crafty enough to arrange your work schedule around meetings, you can actually move from one meeting to another for a whole week, without actually performing any real job as long as you talk your way around the great projects or ideas that should be implemented and take down any new initiatives or real work done by others.Align yourself with the VP of Merch/marketing and you are done and don't ever go against any of the buyers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Toxic work environment, you can actually spent days without talking to anyone.No vision of the future at the leadership level.Every day there is a Fire drill kind of environment, where the only thing you do is take out fires (problems) and being careful not to be blamed for the causes of the problem.Patrick Byrne made a great idea a reality, sadly most of his time, ideas and money are spent in fighting everybody else with lawsuits (wallstreet, hedge funds, gary weiss,banks etc) and talking about naked short selling, which is in fact a problem, but not the cause of Overstock's stock price decline.So the company is headless in terms of direction and lacks vision of the future.Retention rate of employees is very low, the average time a person stays at Overstock is close to 1 year.There is no open communication channel from lower to upper management levels, last initiative was to set up a web interface to allow employees to voice their ideas, but the qualification process of the ideas is in the hands of the same people that truncate the communication to the decision person (Patrick Byrne).Great place if you love to spend your time in Facebook and Youtube, just make sure you have one of those 3M screen protectors, so no one can see from the side what you are doing.No retention strategy for talented employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There is a lot of raw talent, at Overstock due to the location close to BYU and UofU, but it is not fully used because the culture prevalent at Overstock, makes people behave as Know it All's.Once these talented people get a hold of the business, they move to other positions leaving Overstock, without the knowledge because there is never a transition of tasks.Once someone is gone, all the experience and knowledge is gone.</advice-to-management>

“Great benifits, poor leadership.”

</title><pros>Pros – The insurance benifits are superb.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Don't try to get ahead in this company unless you are "in" with someone. Most promotions are based on personal feelings of team leads and supervisors, not you performance or capeabilities. Upper management has been hired from within, that means not many are qualified for the positions and almost all new projects and procedures are always a work in progress, and are usually at odds with the other departments. Working at the call center is a nightmare for the most part.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – When you say you are going to do something, DO IT! Some of your best employees are stuck because hiring managers hire for "Personality" rather than for their qualifications.</advice-to-management>

“Challenging yet rewarding.”

</title><pros>Pros – Interesting technology and smart people make it a dynamic and challenging place to work.  The company likes to promote from within and gives plenty of lateral movement opportunities.  Management encourages people to step out of they're domains and learn new angles or work in different departments.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pace is very fast and at times too fast.  People can easily get driven into the ground and burn out if they're not careful.  Some technology mandates have seemed more political in nature rather then based on needs.  Many options are simply disregarded for reasons that don't always make sense.</cons>

“Excellent place to work!”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com pays higher than any call center I've come across. The benefits are excellent! Overstock.com is #2 best customer service, It shows in the way us employees are treated here. We are treated with respect, there's lost of communication and that in turn affects the customer service that is provided to all of our customers! This company has lots of room for advancement, you really have to apply yourself and make sure you voice where you want to go.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Definitely high school like atmosphere here. But that is expected with a call center. Definitely something easy to get over though.</cons>

<cons>Cons – IT/dev runs the place - all other divisions run scared - if your not in IT then accept your inferior position - no career path for qa/ba's/business - just work & get paid half decently - but you'll be a little clog for ever - they fired/demoted all the qa management and want you to be agile (under it department)-there are a few guys in top management who are there for life bec of relations w/the ceo-and middle management by another bunch of guys -also hordes of h1 guys with their appls screwed up & stuck</cons>

“I wouldn't recommend it to others”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com is good about it's reasonable work schedules for salaried employees, depending on the job position. Overstock, from my experience, has not tried to take advantage of it's salaried employees by overworking them or expecting that they work 60 hour weeks. There are a few company sponsored programs that allow for growth that are given to it's employees. The company also offers a floating holiday which can be taken 1 of 4 days which allows a bit more flexibility in planning time off. The view from the corporate office has a beautiful outlook at the mountains.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Compensation for work is somewhat non-competitive when compared to the field. To rub salt in that wound, the company is rather open about the fact that it is intending to hire many new members, making it obvious that the lack of pay is not due to the fact that the company does not have the funds for it but rather, a choice made by the management.The process by which an employee is let go is obscure without offering any insight into what happened or how you yourself can avoid a similar fate. Office politics run rampant, and while employees are openly judged bi-yearly by their managers with little ability to speak out against an unfair rating, they have no ability to rate their managers in return, or even speak out against a bad one. In addition, the system on which they are rated is undefined until the moment that they are rated, leaving one wondering exactly what they will be judged on at this particular moment in time.Parking is atrocious at the corporate office, with not nearly enough parking spaces provided for the employees, and most new employees have to park in the overflow lot and take a shuttle to work.While the company does provide some web courses for people to take that it touts are worth college credits, these are primarily a bone thrown to it's customer service department, and useless to anyone who already has a college degree and is looking to expand their education.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It has been said a few times that one of the realizations that happened with the overstock management was that it's employees were valuable and paying for ones that do good work was worth the extra money. Lately these words seem to have rung hollow, and instead it feels more as if the employees are yet another piece of overstocked merchandise that when it can't be utilized is simply thrown to the wayside.Provide more accountability upward as opposed to simply in one direction. Allow employees to have an anonymous voice for whether or not they feel like they're being treated fairly by their managers.Allow more insight into the reasons why people are let go so other people can avoid making the same mistakes. And if there is no good reason why someone was fired, then perhaps that's an indication that they were fired for the wrong reasons.Get more parking spaces.Offer real opportunities for growth, not just to the people working for the CS department but across the company.</advice-to-management>

“A late phase startup struggling to be profitable. Lots of smart dedicated people with reasonable working hours.”

</title><pros>Pros – If you like to Ski, hike some of the best in the country is only 20-30 min from the office and they are in need of many Java developers and QA. You will not get overworked unless you want. The non management employees are all nice people and fun to work with. Most are highly skilled but underutilized. The pay for developers is fair for the middle of the country.- Housing (renting) is very reasonable and very negotiable in SLC area.- Great outdoor activities very close to work- Traffic, what traffic?- Easy to live 10-15 min from office- Great Skiing, Hiking very close to everything.- Everything is 30min away including Park City which is a very commutable distance.- Other tech companies are moving into SLC such as Google, EBay, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company sells its self as a mature company with lots of potential for growth and profitability yet Sr Management is unexperienced and behaves like an early stage startup. An example of this how often they re-organise which is about as often as the wind changes direction. You just might get moved out to SLC and find yourself re-orginized out of a job with no return ticket. The separation is two weeks pay + unused vacation.- Don't sell you house if you are moving to SLC from afar, rent it.- Once you start, forget what they told you during the interview process. They are not looking for any constructive criticism or input for improvement to their systems. Keep your head low, do you job  as asked and no more.- If you have not been there for 4-5+ years your an outsider. Remember this.- Vacation time is 15 days but that includes your sick days. Don't get sick or go to work when your sick.- 401k does not start for 6 months- Do not make yourself known at the SVP level. If they don't like you or have a bad day, your gone quicker than a roll of the dice in Vegas. It does not matter how much value you have added in the past.- Winter pollution inversions are just nasty. Worst air in the country for this entire week.- If you have kids the public schools in UT (Other than Park City) are about as bad as they get. So you will have to look into one of the two high end public schools both of which are about $15k/year/child. The other private schools seem to only be a bit better than the public schools but nothing like the schools on either coast and are religiously oriented.- The moving bonus requires you to stay for a year or pay it back.- Most of the upper management have only worked at Overstock or perhaps one other company after getting out of school. They do not understand how the rest of the world operates have have a very ignorant view of it.- Huge culture shock if you are not a member of the XXX Church.- If you are a really smart creative person, you will not have the opportunity to express yourself here.- If you need a job for a year it might be a place to work until the economy gets better.- You might want to not accept any "moving bonus" which would give you the flexibility of leaving when you want.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There are some very smart people working for you but they are not allowed to challenge the "old timers" without fear of reprisal. This comes from the top down. Several of your upper managers (business and technology) are not qualified to be leading at the level they are at. Promotion from within is a great idea but just because someone has been there for many years does not qualify them to lead. A mature company needs a mature management team which does not make emotional knee jerk decisions.Have an outsider evaluate your Sr management team and help you determine if they are the proper people to run you business. The current team will/is failing you and will not allow you grow as you would like and need.</advice-to-management>

“Needs some real help . . .”

</title><pros>Pros – Very good about giving time off, even if there is no PTO available. The people who do regular functions for the company are fun to work with and very competent in their work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Upper management wants it to be the best company to work for, but a lot of things will have to change before that happens. Extreme culture of nepotism and cronyism.  Many cases of "failing up"; employees performing so poorly that they are moved up because no one wants to work with them, consequently, Overstock has very, very poor management. If you are educated, smart or hardworking, and want to advance in a career, avoid Overstock.com like cancer. Unless you are good friends with management, you'll never move up or get paid an appropriate wage. I could write a 1000 page book on what's wrong with this company. It goes without saying, this company will never even make the top 100 companies to work for.</cons>

“What they're doing wrong...”

</title><pros>Pros – Diverse, plenty of opportunities to grow or try something new, some very good managers, mainly in IT and Merchandising, great people to work with for the most part.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Ridiculous amounts of money spent on moving people, I've heard rumors of 6 figure moves coming up next year and I don't understand the reasoning behind them.  It's a huge waste of money the vast majority of the time, and there have been cases where my department has moved one month, only to move back the next!  We should have stayed with our 6 floors, but now we may be moving to a warehouse...how much will that area cost to build out, and will that be enough room for us now that we are growing steadily?Management: the vast majority of managers, especially in Marketing, are the WORST when it comes to communicating with their teams, us underlings.  Of course when a project deadline is approaching the communication is fine (Get it DONE!), but when moves are coming up, hiring new people, we usually don't hear about it until the day before which is a joke.  There are also a lot of people who come up with some great ideas, of course they don't get the recognition for them, their manager or (most often) executive does.  This is something I like to call an executive "stab in the back" versus what we should be getting, and executive "pat on the back".  One person in particular is notorious for this, but specifics shouldn't be necessary.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – TALK to your people, recognize those that actually DO the work, we're all sick of people playing favorites for whatever reason, stop wasting money on needless moves and start planning (realistically) on where we're going to get the space some departments need, I really don't think the warehouse is a good idea.</advice-to-management>

“"Lateral Move" Anyone?”

</title><pros>Pros – The culture here is great, everyone is accepted and pretty much everyone from every walk of life has or will work here.I feel respected and like I really do have a family here.Opportunities for advancement are everywehere.  I started out in customer service and was promoted right out of training.Good benefits, lots of PTO, easy to get time off (as long as it's not 4th quarter :) very flexible with schedules, they have worked around my "single mom schedule" countless times.Many new learning opportunities and easy to get feedback where it's needed.There is a lot of overtime opportunities during the holidays.Many company sponsored events, Lagoon day, concerts, parties.  Also lots of fun things always going on in the office.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Sometimes they go on what seems like "firing sprees" and you don't know why or who they are targeting. It makes you nervous for weeks that you're next.Bonuses need to make sense. You do mediocre business one year and get a huge bonus and then the next year, your business exceeds everyone's expectations and your bonus is 1/3 of what it was last year(??).Upper management has a habit of holding meetings where they tell you how amazing you did and how much money you made for them and in the very next breath, they will tell you how they're cutting PTO hours or how there's not going to be any raises this year.  Good thing we made all that money for them... The pat on the back is getting old, we have families to raise too.You don't get paid the standard even with the cost of living constantly rising.  I know many people in customer service that have had to go on food stamps and utility assistance.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Tell us WHY you are doing what you're doing if you can.  It makes people insecure and slighted to always be in the dark.It's nice to hear how much money we have made or how good we did in a survey, but maybe you could start paying the "little guys" a living wage since we're the roof of your Grecian Temple.</advice-to-management>

“It's a good company”

</title><pros>Pros – -A lot of good people working here.-It's a solid company with a bright future.-Top level management seems very solid</pros>
<cons>Cons – -My job could easily be done from a remote location, but that's not permitted.-Sick days should be allotted along with traditional PTO because w/o sick days people don't want to waste their vacation time because they're not feeling well, so they come into work sick and get other sick as well (I'm guilty of that because I never seem to have enough PTO)-Awful visibility into bonus structure, so it doesn't serve as the effective motivator that it could be - I feel there is a lot of missed potential there.-Merch hiring from CS is very common which provides for cheap labor but the level or professionalism can suffer as a result - seems like a good short term ROI strategy but I question the long term viability of real improvement.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – -My Cons list could use some attention and there are some easy wins there.-VPN access with remote office locations permitted.-Sick days in addition to regular PTO-Clear bonus structure with clear visibility</advice-to-management>

“One opinion of Overstock as a place to work.”

</title><pros>Pros – With few exceptions, everyone I work with genuinely loves working here.  They are all hard workers and knowledgeable concerning their job functions.  Most of the people here have worked their way up and are familiar with the business processes to complete their assigned tasks.  They are fair in all aspects of work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – At times it is difficult to determine just how much my contribution is valued.  I don't need a consistent pat on the back but a monthly pow wow would be very helpful to assess just where I and my team mates are with management.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – enforce monthly team meetings.  I know some don't like them, but it's better to have all team members know where they stand in the company than to have them go about their daily duties wondering if their contribution is meaningful.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – I love what I do and I like the people I work with. Its good pay in comparison to other jobs out there.</pros>

<cons>Cons – I never considered myself a workaholic before working at overstock, but I find myself working through lunches, staying late... etc.  Sometimes this is a high-stress job.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The leadership would be wise to listen to feedback and specific advice from the little people in the trenches.

“My 2 cents”

</title><pros>Pros – Great Salary. Easy to approach Management. If you can get to the right people they are willing to listen to your ideas. Teams are very open and work well together. Little politics around.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Headquaters are in Salt Lake City and it is difficult to attract talent to the area.PTO is lacking behind what other companies are offering.Lots of incompetent people hiding in the mix and they are difficult to remove despite providing facts.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – 1. Hire better trained project managers. It is a crucial role in making projects successful and very careful thought should be given as to who is given the role. Just cause someone is good at talking or is presentable does not necessarily make them good PMs.2. Listen to Team leads more on what is important for their respective department. They are your nerve center on how the company is doing.3. Promoting from within is important however every once in a while bring in outside talent to keep up with the industry. There are several departments that are lacking in this.</advice-to-management>

“Great place to work, still lots of opportunities to make a difference”

</title><pros>Pros – - Challenging and interesting work- Exciting, leading-edge technology- Wonderful people to work with- Very little political nonsense- Truly a fun place to work</pros>
<cons>Cons – - CEO is distracted- Unbudgeted spending- Management is not good at planning ahead- Not a lot of "gray hair" running the business</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – - The whole exposée on the Facebook relationships between journalists and fund managers was a complete embarrassment to Overstock.  It looks like we are trying to distract people or hide something from them, and it comes off looking childish.  We should be focused on running the company and staying out of the mud.  "Never wrestle with a pig, you get dirty; and besides, the pig likes it." - George Bernard Shaw- Lawsuits are not a revenue stream.- We waste so much time, energy and money with all the moves we do around here.  Build the same cubicles, offices and conference rooms on every floor.  When it's time to move, the only expense will be cardboard boxes for people to carry their things to their new desk that looks exactly like the old one they just left.  No more knocking down walls, running electrical, networking, and so on.</advice-to-management>

“I've always loved working here”

</title><pros>Pros – -Having a CEO that walks around and asks what you're up to so he knows his business from the ground up.-Having a CEO with a social conscience-Upper management that have senses of humor-Good health benefits- in over 4 years there's only been one time our insurance has said "no" (and I'm still working on getting that yes)-Move up from within!  You can start out on the phones but if you learn everything you can, you can end up being a decision maker one day.</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Sometimes if you're the person doing your job well and not causing problems, you're the one that's overlooked. (Squeaky wheel gets the grease you know)-Pay rarely matches what most others make at other places.  I've always said "you have to really want to work here"....cause it won't be for the pay, but there's so many other trade offs that make it worthwhile.  Still, it would be nice to make industry standard</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There's a general feeling sometimes that only "the beautiful people" get plucked from a crowd and taught how to be "the next big thing" while others fight their way up the ladder.  Although many of us know there's a lot of determination and drive that's looked at it does seem (quite often actually) that positions are created for the beautiful people while everyone else waits for a job to post so they can have the opportunity for the spotlight,  to toot their own horn and a have chance for advancement.This may not be the case- but it's the perception, and that's what needs to be managed.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Great opportunities to cross train in different areas of the business.  Progressive environment that encourages innovation.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Communication between departments can be poor.  The result is many reports, and processes are duplicated.  Projects are occasionally developed without the input of all the stakeholders.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – 1. The department of excellence needs to work more with the management of the department they are directed to evaluate.2.  Some of the process engineers are duplicating work done by the departments they are analyzing.3.  Take any business areas that are not performing off life support.4.  Focus on core competencies:  Internet retailing.  Taking on the role of a travel agent, realtor and car sales person might not be in line with these competencies.  If these are good business ideas maybe they should be developed as standalone businesses.  If they prove to be successful business models consider bringing them into the fold.</advice-to-management>

“A great place to work, with only a few dodgy management decisions.”

</title><pros>Pros – Salary, benefits, promotion opportunities and the general population are all above average. Your workload is quite reasonable and it's a fine place to make a living.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There's a lot of seasonal hiring and when the layoffs come around, some of the decisions seem arbitrary. Many good employees are at a risk for loosing their jobs and a lot of sub par employees seem to stick around much longer than you'd expect. There's also an odd emphasis on irrelevant issues like adherence to the schedule, even though calls and special projects make it difficult or inconvenient to take breaks at the exact time they are scheduled.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Lower the emphasis on adherence and "Hot Topics" because they are irrelevant to the job. Figure out a way to calculate "Actual Work Done" because there are many employees who get good stats but are doing only the easiest possible tasks.</advice-to-management>

“Great people to work with.”

</title><pros>Pros – The company is not afraid to try new things.  Ideas on their merits, not their presenter.  Almost everyone here is a good person to work with - i.e. we don't hire jerks.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Sometimes the company is too slow to recognize that a person is a poor performer.  We usually deal well with this, but if an employee becomes a "favorite child" of someone in senior management, it can take several notable failures before they are recognized as incompetent.Office space is getting tight, and is leading to compromises which impact productivity and satisfaction.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The company is sometimes too quick to change direction on a whim.  We sometimes loose sight of strategic goals to pursue the latest "shiny new thing".  Being willing to take a slightly longer term view would, I believe, not only make the company more successful, but also more satisfying to work for.</advice-to-management>

“Do not read this review.”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock is good at hiring smart, motivated people and does not drag its feet when it needs to let someone go who is not cutting it. They do a good job of rewarding performance and are very reasonable about managing work/life balance. There is a lot of room for innovation and learning.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As mentioned above, you can easily be let go if you don't do a good job. I think this is a positive thing, but some people probably wouldn't like it.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more clear about how the bonus pool is determined. It seemed that the formula that was established a few years ago (10% of nectar improvement) was abandoned, but nothing was ever said to employees. In my experience, bonuses have been generous, but it can still be frustrating to not know what to expect.A more consistent vision would also be encouraging. It seems like every year we're told, "Don't worry about GMS growth -- watch nectar growth." Then at some point everyone panics because GMS is too low.</advice-to-management>

They embrace all types of people and encourage diversity. Even with such a veriety of people working here, everyone still gets along and is happy to come to work everyday.

</title><pros>Pros – Great people, everybody is down to earth, great benefits, excellent opportunities for advancement, great atmosphere, good pay.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Processes change a lot and sometimes we will get a call about the issue before we are notified of the updated information from the company. Have to work weekends (not a big deal at all but would prefer for us to be closed every weekend :)  )</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – More thorough training for the new employees. Relay new updates to company before they take place. Put everybody through training again once a year to refresh our mind. Employees should be offered promotions based on the quality of the work they currently do. We should not be judged on who we know and how good of a recomendation a supervisor gives us. It seems as though there is a lot of favoring for people who are more popular. Which is very shocking considering how good all of the other aspects of this company are. I know people who moved up very quickly and only did a fair job in their previous position before the promotion (coincidentally they are very popular here). I always got praised on how excellent my work was, yet it was quite a fight to move up. Other leads do a not so good job and still hold their position somehow.</advice-to-management>

“The best company I ever worked for”

</title><pros>Pros – The Company tries very hard to insure that everyone feels like part of the OVerstock.com family.  they try very hard to make idividual workers feel empowered to get there job done and insure that the best result for the company and the customer.  They also have an award winning team in customer service that they show quite a bit of praise for on a regular basis.</pros>
<cons>Cons – there are some occasional situations where people may get favored over others because of who they know well or who they are related to.  for as good at intercompany comunication it could be even better with the right systems in place.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep on doing such a good job.  any complaints I have will probably be fixed on there own with out me even filling this out or are to be expected in any company</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Define career paths better within each department.  It isn't enough to tell us to use our online campus (O University rocks!).  Tell us what skills we need to advance, advise us on how we can acquire those skills, and build more programs to support.  There are some, I am just saying we need more and they should be specific to each department.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com is a great place to work.”

</title><pros>Pros – Open,  very even handed communication between staff and management. Personal issues are considered in every aspect: no rules are unbendable, but the fact that an employee is a person with a real life is always factored in.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is a certain amount of high schoolish popularity contest that seems to go along with the youth of this company. Advancements and opportunities seem to be reliant as much on how fun and personable someone is as much as how much actual effort they put into doing a job well. Also, decisions are made about perks--activities and recreational items, by a small select group rather than a majority agreement.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management would do well to pay attention to the little guy--the people who do the dirty work of the actual customer contact. It seems that all of the perks and praise are alloted in the trickle down method, and we just get to hear about rewards and advancement. The employee of the month should be someone who answers the phone, not one of the people who monitors and assesses that work.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Overall, a healthy corporate culture.Good technology--no career stagnation here.Life-work balance.OSTK is a good corporate citizen.OSTK is not a sinking ship; there is hope for my future here.Good teamwork.Approachable management.Problems get solved quickly; roadblocks get removed.No entrenched institutional incompetence; bumbling bureaucrats are not a protected class.Agile development environment means we DELIVER; we get stuff done.OSTK treats its customers well--I'm proud to be a part of that.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Though agile works well here, and I actively support it, there are disadvantages. The environment can get loud. Distractions and interruptions must be managed.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Actively distinguish between the hard-working vs. those just skating by. If you don't, it's a complete sham. And it undercuts your own ability to lead in the future. If you have a hard working committed team mate beside one who's just punching the clock so to speak, and you treat them as equals, that is shameful (and it's really demotivating).</advice-to-management>

“A different company to work for--in a good way!”

</title><pros>Pros – Work/Life balance is good.  Management treats employees as resources.  They generally weed out the back-stabbing jerks that many companies promote.  There is a good sense of "we're all in this together" that I find refreshing.  Overall, it is a professional environment that rewards you for your contribution to the team.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Due to the quickly changing nature of retail sales, projects are sometimes delayed or discarded because a higher-priority request displaces it.  It keeps things interesting, but it can also be frustrating to not complete projects that you have invested a lot of time.  It's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I would like to hear more about the annual goals of the company and how we are measuring up to those goals.

“Overstock.com, a great place to work at.”

</title><pros>Pros – I personally have been in many other jobs in the past and I did not think that I would enjoy it here as much as I do.  The family that we have here at Overstock.com is incredible.  There are so many people and everybody has different views.  The diversity here is awesome, and most everybody cares about our family here and also the customers.  I couldn't think of a place that I'm prouder to work at than Overstock.com.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The only problem that I have ever had with working at Overstock.com is the difference between shifts.  It seems like there is always a fight between the people who work the daytime shift and the people who work the nighttime shift.  I'm sure that situations like this happen at other places as well, but the amount of favoritism shown to certain shifts is a bit disheartening.  Regardless, of all the gripes that one could have about a company, this is a small one.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please realize that regardless of what shift a representative works, we are all great employees.  Please try nto to show favoritism to the daytime shift.  It is hard enough to try and motivate nighttime employees.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Very good atmosphere to work inVery diverse as far as the people that are hired.The people that are hired at corp, warehouse and in Customer Service have to be the greatest bunch of people I have ever known.Patrick Byrne is an amazing person and very interesting to learn about. I also like the fact that he is not just a name, he wanders around and meets people, and he remembers who he meets.  I will work at Overstock hopefully for years and years to come. It is AMAZING....  I wish the pay was a little better, but to be honest, I would work here for less.</pros>

“Wonderful, friendly work environment”

</title><pros>Pros – I have been working at Overstock.com for a little over two months, and I have been very impressed with the work environment. In other workplaces, I've struggled with employees who had power struggles and felt they needed to boss me around and belittle me because I wasn't in a position of authority like they were.The opposite is true at Overstock.com. I feel comfortable talking to executives like they were my best friends, and I have never felt that they didn't respect me because I was brand-new. The CEO and all of the vice presidents and other executives of the company are humble, friendly and completely open with their praise and occasional criticism. Their positive attitudes have in turn helped me to become a more productive employee, and I look forward to coming to work each day in an environment where no one is made to feel inferior to anyone else.I also value the teamwork that I feel at Overstock.com. Each one of the departments in the company works with others to make sure that everything goes smoothly, and each department is valued equally. I am impressed that everyone gets along and is simply trying to improve the company's performance. Even with good-natured competitions such as food drives and raffles between buildings and departments, the employees at Overstock.com work together and never put each other down, and that is something I value highly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The only cons I can think of while working at Overstock.com are that I sometimes feel like I don't have much to do in my position. However, this is not a fault of the company's but is a fault of the changing online industry that requires different techniques and tactics all the time. Once I have settled into a routine here at the company, I'm sure I will feel more fulfilled as an employee.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I am very impressed with how you and your executives have run this company and how dedicated you are to honest business practices. I am always proud to tell friends and acquaintances that I work at Overstock.com, because I feel that it is rewarding to work for a company that is dedicated to making life easier for millions of people across the world. There are no hidden fees, no ploys to get people to buy poorly-made merchandise to get it off our hands. You are a bunch of hard-working, ethical people who want to save everyone money -- and you're doing a great job. I'm excited to be a part of the team!</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I can't speak for other positions but PAMs are required to be experts in too many fields. Partner Billing, Fulfillment and CS issues on top of product knowledge and general merchandising can be a lot to keep up on. Increasing the size of teams like Partner Accounts Payable so they can take the lead on more issues would be extremely helpful so we could focus on merchadising.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – They are very understanding of family issues for example, I have worked at the Big O for  year now and have had a couple of Family Emergencies and my supervisors were always very supportive.</pros>
<cons>Cons – REQUIRED WEEKENDS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE- You know Customer Service agents have a family too, and its nice that we can leave early on the day before the holiday, but if it falls before the weekend it would be nice to be given those days off,  so we can have the long weekend like the supervisors do or UPPER MANAGEMENT to take a holiday vacation. If we have to come in to work the weekend to work and the holiday was a Friday or Thursday, it kind of ruins our Holiday Plans.</cons>

“Overall, excellent company to work for.”

</title><pros>Pros – Very liberal work enviroment with freedom to make decisions.  A lot of learning opportunities.  Positive work enviroment with great morale, a lot of influencial dynamic people to work with.  Challenging, yet rewarding job responsibilities.  Executives and upper level management are fair and conduct themselves in an exemplary manner.  They are personable and are great to work for.  Compensation and bonuses are great.  Benefits and 401K are also great.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Advancement opportunities are hard to come by in this company.  Occasionally, there can be a lack of communication and support from direct managers.  Lacking a formal training class and cirriculum for new hires as it relates to the individual jobs.  Time off days for new hires less than 2 years should be a day or two more than what is currently offered.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Overall an excellent company to work for.  It may help some people thrive a bit more to offer performance incentives occasionally.  It may also help new employees to the company to have one or two more paid time off days per year until they reach thier two year mark.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – The compensation is a bit lacking for the work and time you have to put in.  Especially when you are salary, you are asked to give up your family time to help the company succeed.  Many times, you make as much as a fast food worker when you divide the hours you put in by what you are paid.</cons>

“A perfect job for the overly social and painfully personable”

</title><pros>Pros – They have a relaxed and understanding environment, friendly coworkers, and can be flexible if you have scheduling needs. They empower you to actually help most customers without having to transfer all over the facility. plus it just feels good to hear a customer go from livid to grateful because you can do something for them.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It can very stressful when you come across issues that you cannot solve yourself or that will take a long time to notate and deal with properly. There is a lot of abuse that customers throw at you from time to time and there are times when the frequency of calls can get to you.</cons>

“Generally Satisfied”

</title><pros>Pros – The best part of working here is that there is a very friendly atmosphere. I like most of the people I work with, and my immediate supervisors have always been good people. The benefits are pretty good, not as good as they used to be, but still not bad.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I know that most people who do what I do get paid quite a bit more, but I hang on thinking that one day I'll get paid what I'm worth. I've had a hard time trying to prove that not anyone can do what I do as well as I do, and management often sends the message that we can easily be replaced, even if they don't intend to.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I've seen a few people who do a lot less work than I do get promoted just because they are willing to suck up to management, and I think that's a little insulting to those of use who work hard but don't have that kind of personality. My advice would be to recognize that people who are quietly doing their jobs are still doing great -- and possibly better -- work.</advice-to-management>

The manager is unable to do any follow up, if you send her an email in never seems to be address.

“At work with The O”

</title><pros>Pros – Most of the managers i have encountered have encouraged growth within the company by sharing their knowlegde and helping their employees succeed in the tasks they have given. Overall there are very positive people in management positions who are open and helpful to the associates they are in charge of.</pros>
<cons>Cons – In my departmental transfers i have had difficult transitional periods adjusting to a head-strong individual who possesses an aggressive micro-management style but lacks the overarching grasp of his possition to assign tasks that have clear conditions in which the goals were to be achieved. Luckily, my flexibility allows a sort of middle ground where i get my job done without affecting anything adversely.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Most of the managers here show a willingness to get "into the trenches" and work alongside their associates shouldering the load when days get hectic, it's very comendable to see that motivation of "do as i do", rather than managing from a chair relying solely on delegation of leg work to leads to pass information up and down the chain. And it's not just middle management, the upper echelon of leadership is not afraid to get out on the floor and work up a sweat.</advice-to-management>

I have heard of executives doing everything from paying someone's rent in an emergency to covering the cost of a funeral for an employee. They have employee only scholarships and things of that nature.</pros>

“Great Place to Work”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com is very supportive of their employees moving up in the company.  They offer learning courses, provide opportunity to increase skill levels to help the employee reach their goals.  Management works hard at making Overstock.com a fun place to work.  Our CEO, Patrick, does not come across as too good to associate with the employees, he is very approachable and is open to the opinions of the employees.  Senior management and management are always striving to show their appreciation to Customer Service for all the work they do.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If I had to choose one thing that is a downside of Overstock.com it would be that the training is somewhat lacking.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – That training of new hires, be more comprehensive.  The training given to the new hires, does not touch on International customers.

“I provide expedited resolution to customers with difficult situations.”

</title><pros>Pros – I was hired on in October and found myself promoted within 3 weeks. I love that this company only promotes from within. There is no need to worry that someone who does not understand the company will be moved into a supervisory or corporate position. There is definite room for self improvement and growth for anyone coming on board with no previous call center experience. If you have more to bring to the table, you are regarded as a gem and treated with respect; recognized for what you have to offer. There is a sense of family with Overstock.com that I have never felt while working with another company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – At this time, I can't think of any. I love the fact that there is not a lot of stress in regards to "accidental overtime". If you have an hour or two posted to your paycheck, you aren't reeemed for it. Also, I have worked previously in a call center environment. You are allowed to document the reasons why you were not following your schedule and the information is updated in the system. You are treated like an adult and are not faced with disciplinary action for things that are not in your realm of control.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep up the good work. I would recommend more training programs for agents that would like to cross train for other departments - i.e. A+ certification, Spainish as a second language, etc; Anything that would help to improve the quality of the wonderful agents that you already have on the floor. And I would recommend more synchronized dancing for the senior staff. That was fantastic.</advice-to-management>

“Ethics of Retail?”

</title><pros>Pros – Good pay, really nice and understanding management.  A cubicle with a window view.  I can't stress how much better that made my job.  Everyone trusts eachother in my department, which is huge as well.  I never felt like my opinion didn't matter or was flat out wrong.  The training was also incredibly thorough and well done so that I learned my job well instead of quickly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Overstock.com is a glorified outlet store.  As much as we try to push Worldstock, it is still hard for me to be passionate about working here.  As a company we add nothing to the world at large.  Sure overstock.com provides jobs in Salt Lake, and some revenue to the area, but besides that we aren't valuable contributers to society.  On the one hand I like the idea of cutting out the middle man (the retail store seems like an antiquated concept), but on the other, we are actively engaged in the process of hurting local businesses.  How do we reconcile this?  I would bet that the vast majority consider their jobs at overstock just that, jobs, and nothing more.  If there is a way to change this then that would be the only way to get people to truly believe in Overstock.com</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep your war on wallstreet as separate as possible from the brand name of Overstock.com.  This battle that is deepcapture directly hurts Overstock.com stock prices, and therefore hurts employees of overstock who have good faith enough to invest in the company.  It seems that it is an obsession and at times boils down to not much more than name calling.  Enlist other parties to fight this war for you, remove your name from the battles.  If it's truly about the ethics of it all then you shouldn't be worried about the credit you will receive.</advice-to-management>

“Great place to work, overall”

</title><pros>Pros – You can expect an honest working environment at Overstock.com. The first thing that they tell you when you're hired is "If you're caught in a lie, there goes your job." I've had a few difference managers, all of which have good support for family values, work ethic, and schedule flexibility. The pay is great, and the hiring process is rigorous enough that few (if any) slackers get hired.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Although there are opportunities for advancement within the company, most of them are management positions. There are few opportunities to advance purely on a technology level, even though the IT department (software dev, operations, etc) is quite large. Unless you are in management, don't expect anyone in management to really listen to your ideas. Even if you've been with the company for years, the lack of advance in job title says a lot.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – To the VPs and Directors, have more one-on-ones with those on the bottom of your food chain. There are things your direct reports would never tell you.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Successful Company - high upside</pros>
<cons>Cons – Poor internal communication.  Projects are poorly managed due to Project Managers not being given accountable resources leading to wasted time, bloated projects, and poor internal resource development.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Form temporary project teams that overlap functional teams and report to project managers in addition to functional managers.  Project Managers then report directly to VP’s.  Project team members (for support) are then allowed opportunities beyond the day to day and business people are able to learn how to communicate with IT people and IT people are able to see firsthand the importance of business functions.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – work/life balancecompensation is top notchemployee skill level is higher than average with many top talents in the industryManagement is knowledgeable and they make good decisions for what's best for the company as a whole and not just individual teams or departments.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Sometimes I think that management sets a goal or specific criteria to meet and then all decisions are based on meeting that goal even if it isn't the best thing to do. They become paralyzed from doing anything that might interfere with the all mighty goal they have set and therefore make stupid decisions instead of making smart and calculated risks ignoring the benefits to be had.</cons>

“Working at Overstock.com”

</title><pros>Pros – Very casual and comfortable atmosphere. Has a good benefits package. Reasonably good teaching environment supported by an internally developed on-line university, which is constantly improving.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Almost no potential for career advancement. Poor leadership support from management. Management strongly embraces a "Don't make waves" environment. Essentially no opportunities to provide feedback for management (this is the first time) or internal support departments.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – We need more of a push for teamwork between departments. Our environment is too contentious right now, we need to work towards a more cohesive operation between departments and move away from the current "Pass the buck" and "Don't make waves" feeling that we have now. The more people feel comfortable in voicing their thoughts and ideas, the more good ideas will float to the top. Last but definitely not least, give credit where credit is due. There is a lot of favoritism that happens in all departments, but no one dares to say anything.</advice-to-management>

“A good place to start, not a place to stay”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock is very flexible in allowing each person to find the niche that fits them best.  Once you are past your first year, you can easily move to another area of the company to try another job that interests you.  For the most part, the middle management is talented, competent, and professional.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Senior management are no where nearly as knowledgeable about e-commerce as they should be.  They form cliques with select middle management and only promote their favorite people not based on talent or job performance but because they are social friends.  These "social promotions" into middle management have ruined certain areas of the company since the individual promoted has no talent and isn't up to the job at hand.  Constructive criticism is taken personally, so one doesn't question their marching orders from senior management for fear of losing one's job.  Pay is inequitable and based on whether senior management likes you personally, not your job performance.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Senior management needs to do the following:1)  Learn to take constructive criticism not as a personal attack but positive feedback.2) Get rid of the "everyone is expendable" attitude; it's disconcerting when you say you want more loyalty to the company yet treat the talented people who do all the work as expendable.3) Value your employees through more postitive work related feedback and pay what they are worth based on job performance, work experience, and educational background.4) Stop promoting your friends and promote whoever is best for the job.5) Establish an "Overstock Mentor" program to provide employees with a way to learn from those who have been at the company longer, help increase knowledge sharing and employee performance, and help diversify employees' skills.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com---What's it really like?”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com has a somewhat laid-back work environment which makes for a good work atmosphere. They seem okay with taking time off when needed for personal reasons, as long as it's not done excessively. Compensation seems to be competitive for the industry.</pros>
<cons>Cons – For a company who believes in the philosophy of 'saving paper clips', they sure like to throw money away on frivolous things, like moving entire departments around all the time, tearing down walls and rebuilding them in different configurations 'just because'. There is definitely an atmosphere of favoritism, and most definitely an atmosphere of 'blame someone else'. Go ahead and throw someone else to the wolves...don't bother to take responsibility for anything.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You have many good people working for you who are willing to give their all---Don't lose them by continuing with the status quo.

</title><pros>Pros – The diversity. Overstock.com welcomes people from all cultures to work here and its great to share in other cultures here at work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The favoritism. When there are openings for specialty teams they will not take on anyone that they are not friends with, even if we are qualified. Agents that are friends with the management get treated much better and they get more understanding about needed schedules. If the manager of Quality does not like you then your stats fail as well.</cons>

“As a job......it pays the Bills”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com pays their employees fairly well for starting out.  They do provide their empolyees with two fifteen minute breaks and one thirty minute lunch.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They do not pay their employees due to experience.  I have been in the customer survice industry for the past nine years and make the same as a kid in high school that works at Overstock.com.  Sicne I have been with Overstock.com I have slowly grown to wonder how they have been around for ten years.  The company stress how important customer satisfaction is, yet management stress getting a certain amount of contacts, which leads employees to cut corners on doing their job.  Rather than taking the time in reading what is going on in a particular incident, employees will touch the incident enough to make a "contact out of it".  If the economy was not in the shape that it is in and jobs where readily available, I would leave Overstock.com and go to where the work that I do can be appreciated.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Fix your system.  Be willing to listen to someone new to the company.  Just becasue the person has not been with the company that long does not mean that they are not able to help the company progress forward.  If you have employees working overtime to assist with work load, let them know how much they are appreciated.  Money is not everything.  I have been with the company now for almost three months and for roughly the past month I have dreaded coming to work due to the fact the management is not focusing on quality.  Instead they are focusing on numbers.  Perhaps this is why Overstock.com was rated one of the worst companies to return items to according to either the today show or good morning america.  Will this make a difference probablly not.  I have personally gone to management about several things with no outcome.  So I will leave it at that.</advice-to-management>

“Upset and dissatisfied at this time, used to be very very happy.”

</title><pros>Pros – I love Patrick and Stormy and thier encouragement and just the spirit they bring to this place. I love the family thing they are trying to create but it wont happen with all the favortism in this place.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I have been here for years and watched people pass me by time after time. I have managenent experience that they have never considered. I see trouble makers that should have been fired years ago be excused for thier actions time and again.  The favortism is at an all time high in this place and seems like more and more people are unhappy and looking for optional jobs as they dont see a future here anymore. It is so frustrating to work hard for years and years with a perfect record with attendance, quality, you name it and then see new team leads that have just got hired and us (oldies) have to train them properly , because they are so new, but making more than you and you should have had thier job in the first place-NOT FAIR!!. You see people you work with for years change when they get power and unfortunatley not for the good. I hope that Stormy and Patrick figure out what is going on around here and fix it before too many of us are gone:(:(</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I dont know what to say. I just know to come in and keep my mouth shut cuz if I say the wrong thing I could be gone but Joe Blow who is one of the managers nieces or brother or such can have the worst attendance and attitude and tehy get promotions. I know that Patrick and Stormy do not see this as I beleive they would not allow this to be going on. I hope other people mention this so someone will look into it. I would sure like to stay with Ostock but I cant stay if things dont change. For the first time here I feel like I have no one I can trust and no one to go to with my issues. I was told NOT to go to Stormy about management or I would be canned. Please Patrick HELP US:(:(</advice-to-management>

“Overall good place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – There are some crazy smart people and just being around them rubs off.  I am able to go to school and still pull my weight.  There are cutting edge technologies and a high level of sophistication in the tools I use to do my job.I appreciate that we are being given an opportunity to comment. It shows a willingness to consider alternate points of view.Stand-up meetings are awesome.  Interacting with management and getting a sense of the "vision" that they have for the company, makes us stand apart.I often hear complaints about being required to move from one desk to another and change floors.  I actually think that this is a good thing and have met and got to know all kinds of people in various departments thanks to this simple strategy.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Maybe it is the stress of the job, but occasionally angry, and unhelpful email messages make it down from the upper levels.  My boss and my bosses boss often find themselves trying to comprehend a email message sent down from "on high" by someone that is completely out of touch with reality.  I am in a position to have seen this from multiple departments and don't believe it is isolated to my department.There is a tendency to play the blame game. Occasional witch hunts result in a environment of fear.  Often the first responder attempting to solve a critical issue gets summarily executed when the solution does not work.I am highly awarded from previous companies and receive regular positive feedback from my peers and those internal customers that I work for, but have a tinfoil hat feeling that I am being stopped in my progression due to misconceptions that persons above me have harbored for years.I suspect that promotion will happen after I leave school and leave the company.  Several long conversations with my colleagues, suggests that I am not alone in that feeling.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – A position of leadership is a service position.  Often a leadership position is not because you are smarter, but because we need someone to make a final decision.If a person sticks their neck out to help and gets whacked when the result is not positive, you are teaching that person to avoid sticking their neck out.The blame game results in a toxic environment within a team.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Working for Overstock has given me my first introduction into medium sized companies.  I've worked for large and small, both growing and shrinking.  This has been a good company to work for that has shown the stability of larger corporations, without the political bull.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management appears to be a good ol' boys club.  If you want to advance your career, this is not really the place, as you have to be a member of the club to advance.  There is no education assistance, meaning that I don't have a corporate support for learning.</cons>

“Customer Service Job Experience with Overstock.com”

</title><pros>Pros – The job itself is fairly simple and satisfying. You get the opportunity to help others, you have a lot of freedom to resolve customer issues in the way you see fit and fair to both the company and the customer. You are given plenty of training not only when you join the company but as well as ongoing training. They have many supportive opportunities such as health advancement with both healthy tips and recipes and community support. The people working for Overstock.com are friendly and diverse, you feel welcome and respected for who you are by your co-workers. There is room for advancement if you are interested and qualified. The benefits are great. Overall, the environment is wonderful as far as the atmosphere and the co-workers. The Customer Service community is fun, open, welcoming and warm.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is very difficult to get positive feedback and you will always be informed of areas you need to improve in. Though there are plenty of job advancements available, it is very difficult to get one of these positions without knowing the right people. There is very little flexibility as far as time off for personal reasons that you may feel are important. There is not a strong feeling of connection or or openness with management. There is no opinion or feedback sharing ability, complaints are frowned upon. It is made clear that if you do not meet all expectations for any reason that there are plenty of others to fill your position. There seems to be a large communication gap between the employees and management as you have nowhere to give feedback on improvements that can be made, complaints that you want to be left anonymously etc. Management does not seem to apply the "open door" policy that most companies do as offering opinions and complaints leave one a bit "flagged." As long as you just do your job and don't try to change or address anything, you will do well with this company. If you want to offer changes, improvements, share opinions and such, this is not the place for it. You are not given a voice without repercussions.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The management should be looked at closely as there seems to be a lot of nepotism, unfair treatment as far as who is picked for promotions or demotions. There is a very large amount of favoritism and many have watched under-qualified new agents take positions that others who were not only more qualified, but had also been with the company longer, had applied for. The person who knows someone in management or has made themselves known to management will get the position above the qualified agent. The "cliques" have grown stronger over time and those in them continue to promote and also continue to be protected against their poor behaviors where others find themselves with write-ups and repercussions. Most are not fond of the customer service management unfair treatment and also unhappy with the protection they offer others who are not following company policies or are even crossing behaviors that are HR worthy. If one wants to promote within customer service or even promote out of it, one must be on the good side of certain parties in customer service management or even if they are qualified and with a clean record, they will never promote and have even been demoted from specialty teams and such so others could stay on or promote who are in favor. Agents discuss and continually wish that the upper corporate management would take interest in the unfair practices and treatments going on at the Customer Service center, but there is no forum for them to get this information to upper management. There needs to be some sort of opinion and complaint forum, box or such for agents to submit this type of information to those above the management team over Customer Service so it can get to ears that have the authority to take interest in it. Most agents have given up and no longer take their issues to anyone and have learned to just stay quiet as previous attempts to have issues address have failed, gone unnoticed, been ignored or ended in retaliations. Management even presses upon agents that they should take all issues to them and NOT to HR as they want to resolve the issues and do not want issues to be taken to the HR level, even if this is where it should be addressed. They have even had HR representative in the past who bring all the issues to their attention even when agents do not want this to be the resolution as the reason they took it to HR is to avoid the ears of management. There are serious issues and many would appreciate it if some of these things were brought to light, addressed or at least investigated.</advice-to-management>

“I'm Fine with Most of It”

</title><pros>Pros – I thoroughly enjoy the department I work with. My co-workers are the reason that I enjoy coming to work every day. I work in a very relaxed, yet professional atmosphere. This company offers excellent benefits and they work well with my schedule. I don't carry the job home with me, it's not that stressful, most of the time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – While I like my department, I feel isolated and ostracized from the rest of the company. I don't feel like we're valued as employees or even people, at times. It also seems that the only time the higher-ups interact with us is when they criticize or make changes to our department. It seems many people use intimidation to make their employees subservient. I don't feel my opinions are valued or given any weight in the company. Sometimes I fear that offering my opinion at all will cost me my job.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't just tell your employees that they are valued - show them. Make sure to show respect to the opinions and feelings of even the lowest positions in the company. Get feedback from the departments that you are considering altering before you make the changes. Your employees have a lot to offer this company.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com call center”

</title><pros>Pros – The pay is very good for customer service and the ability to actually move into different positions is an excellent way to never be bored at work. Many of the people here are very friendly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The locations of the company are very inconvenient and out of the way. Quite a few supervisors are condescending and don't treat people with respect. The call center is located within a warehouse that gets very loud when it rains or if there is a truck in the warehouse and the customers are very displeased with this when this happens. There are also times that supervisors will collect on the call floor and applaud while customer service representatives are on calls nearby. Sound travels very well and makes speaking with customers difficult. There is no covered area for smokers at the call center and does not help with morale.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more personable. If we are happy we are more likely to work hard for you. All you do is talk down to us and you will never get results this way. treat us like humans and we will make you look good.</advice-to-management>

“Review of first impression of OSTK.com”

</title><pros>Pros – the diversity - but the appearance of some employees could be more professional - like one hair color - and pants pulled up on the waist - (no cracks please)</pros>
<cons>Cons – Echocontact 3 is subpar - it doesn't allow you to tell how long you have been on a break - it duplicates ADP time mgt - in my opinion Aveya is a much better and time efficient phone system and WFM - appears to have way to much power, their responsibility is to oversee scheduling do control ones life - the system they use changes schedules constantly and arbitrarily without notice at time and expects people to change their schedules - putting in a system were you bid on a specific schedule and keep it for 3 months at a time without changing it would help alot - WFM forgets that life happens and they act and appear and have way to much power and have a horrible reputation - not to mention the emails we constantly get when we are in wrap up to long (according to WFM) its disruptive and really annoying when you are trying to help a customer - the call center is so far away from civilization - we need ice machines -</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – restructure WFM - leads need to take a more active roll with the people on their team - get rid of the name "seal (s)" - it connotates images of seals wallowing on the beach - there should be cubicles as there is really not much privacy here - when o.t. has been requested and calls holding why is escalations always short staffed? and why are the other departments closed on Sat.? this is a disservice to our customers who try to get ahold of them - tell are a few more issues that I have.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com is a fantastic company to work for but very difficult to get a promotion without knowing the right people.”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com is a great place to work. There are always opportunities to learn new skills and gain new knowledge regarding the company’s business. The company’s corporate office is comfortable and well maintained. Its primary call center and warehouse are brand new facilities that are clean and also well kept.  The CEO is something of a rogue and both inspires and motivates his people to challenge the establishment. The company has a strong interest in system engineering and system improvement which should go a long way in improving company profitability in the near future.  Pay is good for those in the buying and technical departments, if you can land a position with them. Overall, it’s a good company to work for and a good place to learn the online retail business.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The most frustrating part of working for Overstock.com is that it’s very difficult to move up in the company without knowing the right people or having the right contacts. While this is a reality in many companies, it seems to be even worse here. That’s not to say that they don’t give you the chance to learn the business…just that you’ll usually never have a chance to use what you’ve learned. Recommendations to improve operations are welcomed but it seems only by a select group and only through a very ridged chain of command that seems to kill those recommendations before the rise high enough to be evaluated.  The hardest part for me is that I feel as though I’m learning a great deal only to have to go to another company if I ever want to have the chance to put that knowledge to use and advance my career.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The message from the top isn’t always reaching the lower levels of management. It’s not uncommon that we hear powerful and inspiring things from top leadership, only to have the message get lost when it gets to middle and lower management. I recommend opening up to suggestions from your grunts on the front line. You have some amazing and brilliant people working for you. In one specific department that comes to mind, you had enough talent to start a multimillion dollar start-up, and these brilliant individuals were repeatedly passed over for promotion for others with far less knowledge and talent. Overstock .com has the talent and human capital to truly crush the competition but in some areas it will need to get out of its own way to do it.  The humble opinion of one of your loyal grunts.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com Review”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com is a great place to learn quickly about eCommerce.  Most people who work here are easy to get along with.  The health benefits are above and beyond what most other employers are willing to do.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Many times it seems that the 'popular' people are promoted, or others who are just 'yes-men.'  Also, experience within Overstock.com is not as valued as much as job experience else where.  I understand that some projects need a fresh look, but when the new employee is hired with 40% more salary, and has the same skills and experience, that's insult.  Especially when I have to train the new employee.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I suggest that Overstock.com works harder to keep their current employees through promotions and raises.  Also, management needs to give employees a chance to take on new responsibilities and be given recognition for a job well done.</advice-to-management>

“Cons starting to outweigh the Pros?”

</title><pros>Pros – My coworkers are some of the brightest people I've had the pleasure to work with. Their enthusiasm and commitment to excellence is inspiring.Overstock.com supports some great programs - Worldstock and the Wounded Warriors Program are causes I'm proud to be associated with.The company's (theoretical) ideals are ones I respect.Benefits are great.Patrick Byrne private events are fun!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Compared to other companies in the area the wages for my job are especially low.Though I do a great job and take pride in my work I've received no feedback, positive or negative, on my performance.There are policies the company claims to have that are not followed. I don't trust that this survey will remain anonymous, for example.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Take a minute to check in with your employees - let them know you appreciate what they're doing. Show respect for a knowledgeable employee base - we know what we're doing and do it well.When you do ask for input at least pretend to consider it - or don't ask. Complete disregard for input is worse than not being consulted.</advice-to-management>

“It's....fine.”

</title><pros>Pros – The benefits are very good. There's quite a bit of movement within the company, so if you're willing to slide into whatever position needs filling, you can work your way up the chain. The Cottonwood area is nice and the view of the mountains is lovely. The executives are accessable and, for the most part, down-to-earth.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is unremarkable, to say the least. Hourly employees might appreciate it if there were sick time that's separate from PTO. Seating arrangements are strangly close and offer little privacy. It feels like different areas of the company are strongly polarized in terms of how knowlegable and dedicated the employees are; some areas are excellent while other areas seem to be filled with people coasting through life. So if you want a challenging environment where standards are high and deep insights are valued, look elsewhere. I think Overstock.com would a good place to get ahead by being an attaboy or a personal friend of somebody, if that's your preferred method of career advancement.</cons>

“Great place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – It's great to work with really smart  people in a fast-paced environment. There are plenty of great learning opportunities available and tons of interesting projects with which you can become involved.  Employees are mostly very fun and motivated people.  If you're smart and work hard there are lots of opportunities for upward movement within the organization.  CEO is accessible and works closely with employees on a day-to-day basis. He gave me a very generous public compliment on my first day. :) Management is primarily numbers-driven with really clear expectations. Great benefits and lots of paid vacation time.</pros>

<cons>Cons – Company is having a hard time, lots of issues related to shipping which Customer Service has no control over. Benefits package isn't very good at all, not many events for employee's.

“The non-compete is a problem. Outsourcing is ramping up.”

</title><pros>Pros – Management finally responded to the many complaints about the horrible non-compete.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The non-compete is still horrible and still severely limits future career opportunities.  Overstock conveniently brings the non-compete up for the first time on the first day of work after you've uprooted your life, relocated, and turned down other job offers but before they give you access to walk through any doors by yourself.  The same non-compete is used for both experienced employees in key roles and new hires fresh out of college.Since the new non-compete was not made available when it was announced, and the Senior Vice President - Technology / CTO took a determined stance to not make it available until either a position title change occurs or a new bonus is given, here's how the CTO phrased the non-compete changes.  These are his exact words as best as I can remember.  "We've had a lot of complaints about the non-compete and so sat down with our lawyers to update it.  We decided the clause basically limiting employees from working for anyone with a website was overly broad since basically everyone has a website now."  He continued "So we've changed that part to say anyone with a transactional website."The updated non-compete wording still limit's everything from a mom and pop shop which competes with Overstock because they sell t-shirts on the internet and so does Overstock, to Microsoft because Microsoft sells tablets on their website and so does Overstock.  Don't forget Google because Google sells advertising space and Android phones on their website and so does Overstock.  Combine that with Overstock's unpredictable business models which have ranged from selling vacation packages, to insurance, to cars, to homes, in addition to overstocked merchandise and the scope grows even more.Essentially if Overstock chooses to come after you, the non-compete wording forces you or your new employer to take the matter to court, in Utah, or quit your new employer and find another job.  Overstock has done this in the past for relatively low level people.  Over the last few years the non-compete has been frequently updated to restrict more and more future employment options and has become required for more and more people.  The CTO's opinion that this latest update removed the overly broad scope and his determined stance to keep the exact new non-compete wording private until they want you to sign it on the spot scares me.As part of the same meeting it was announced that Overstock will work to outsource 15-20% of it's relatively small development and test staff of around 150.  Luckily these will all be new hires, at least for now.  The cover story is they want to be able to fire 15-20% of the development staff on a whim.  The CTO cited a previous year this happened and basically said better outsourced workers than you.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get serious about fixing the overly broad non-compete.  Reserve non-competes for individuals that are critical to the organization's performance and have key confidential information instead of everyone.  Don't try to retain people by surprising them with a draconian non-compete at the last minute as a condition of employment.  Listen to people involved in the current positions or hiring process instead of just lawyers when drafting the non-compete.   Let the lawyers earn their money and stop using a one size fits all non-compete.  A CTO, an architect, and a new hire out of college have vastly different roles and vastly different access to confidential competitively advantageous information.</advice-to-management>

“IT a mixed bag”

</title><pros>Pros – The work life balance is great and the pay is decent.  Very few teams work more than 40 hours a week.  Schedules are very flexible and the time of day you show up for work is basically left to your own discretion.  If a project date is slipping almost always project features get cut or the date gets extended with overtime very rarely considered a recovery option.  Recent changes are providing opportunity for advancement and existing employees are being considered first for those positions.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Their non-compete agreement is ridiculous.  Get a copy of it before you entertain an offer.  Team leads are given the late night on call responsibilities.  Nepotism and cronyism in the company is rampant.  Despite management saying they hate politics, politics are prevalent, nurtured, and only growing in importance.  A sideways look, a word thought to be disrespectful, or bringing up concerns about the group think strategy of the day are quite literally fireable offenses.  Critical thinking and good project execution seem a distant second to getting along.  Accountability appears to flow only one way.  The practice of hiring from within and cronyism has led to several in positions of authority who from my perspective perform their responsibilities poorly and are unlikely to leave since neither their experience nor aimless performance is likely to qualify them for comparable position and pay in other companies.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Reign in the growing prevalence of politics and cliques.  Encourage thoughtful discussion of opposing viewpoints.  Reward excellence in execution and critical thinking rather than getting along and yes men / yes women.  Nip the environment of intimidation and random firings in the bud.  Have senior management exercise some basic management skill and discuss issues with people when there are issues instead of the first and only step, or preferred go-to action, being immediate termination or forced resignation.  Update the 360 degree review process so it's less dangerous to leave constructive feedback that is critical of management.  It is completely unsafe currently since managers choose who review them and know with certainty who wrote most or all of the 2-4 anonymous reviews they receive.  Most of the shills that managers choose identify the review they wrote and simple process of elimination in the small pool of remaining potential reviewers presented to managers reliably identifies the others.  This leaves the aftermath of retaliation and resentment just another enforcement of what appears to be the fall in line and never bring up flaws company ethos.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Great advancement opportunities! Also, you rarely feel like just another employee. Sometimes you'll go for a bit without being noticed but the environment allows (and encourages) you to put your ideas out there even if it's not your field.</pros>
<cons>Cons – While management is very smart and generally very competent, leaders seem in short supply. Another concern is how much they try to do in a single year. Objectives and planning are ambitious to say the least. This is not necessarily a bad thing but when they plan more projects than IT resources can handle, you end up with a bottle-neck and a lot of people miss their objectives.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Overstock used to be very engaged in leadership trainings, get your leaders back in to these or some great talent will be wasted in a leadership role. Also, before you plan objectives for the year, take the bottlenecks into account. These bottlenecks include more than just IT. When management has to see and approve everything, they become another hold up.</advice-to-management>

“This company is set up to fail.”

</title><pros>Pros – - Able to learn how to use a wide variety of tools.- Friendly coworkers.- Nice location.- Learn how not to do things.</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Idiotic upper management.- No long term vision.- No clear career path for employees.- Constant reorganizing.- Arbitrary compensation.- Depending on your department, there is no work-life balance.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The lack of a long term vision from upper management is one of the biggest concerns of employees. The executive team doesn't look more than a month or two into the future and appears blind-sided by every new development that arises. Compensation needs to be reevaluated across the company. Too many of the best employees are underpaid, and too many overpaid employees that create no value.</advice-to-management>

“Good company with bad communication”

</title><pros>Pros – *They will respect you and not treat you as a mindless drone.*Good benefits package. People who say otherwise don't know how bad other companies can be.*They cover internet and phone if you are on call, with an on call differential*Freedom to help build value in the company, for example choosing which projects to prioritize.*Knowing exactly how you made a difference in the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – *Communication between departments is vague, cryptic and highly political.*Pay disparities. Some people in my same position make 2 times as much as I do if Glassdoor is accurate, but they do the same job I do.*Some people who are afraid to lose their jobs if they let anyone know how to do their job. This leads to poor documentation if there is any at all.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Make communication a company directive. Focus on inter-department communication especially. Create task forces that span several departments and have them meet regularly. Do more evaluation of manager positions and  emphasize that feedback is anonymous. Many people think they will get fired if they say something bad on a survey.</advice-to-management>

“I am glad I work at Overstock and am grateful for the opportunities they have given me.”

</title><pros>Pros – A very diverse work force in a very open work culture makes it almost feel like a university campus - it's great to meet and work with such a group of people.  The company has many progressive programs aimed at helping associates improve themselves and their careers.  Benefits are excellent and competitive.  And the company genuinely cares about morale and making it a place where people want to come to work.I also admiire the philanthropic and charitable personna of our CEO, Dr. Byrne.  Programs like World Stock helping people in third world countries make me proud to be an employee.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company needs to react more quickly to market conditions - and needs to more thoroughly vette its ideas before jumping in with both feet.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Concentrate more on running the business and less on being on every possible Fox business newscast - the business could greatly benefit from your full and undivided attention.  The company might then make better decisions, and do so much more quickly than seems possible now.</advice-to-management>

“Basically, I love my job.”

</title><pros>Pros – For starters, I love the people I work with. There are so many flavors of people here at O.co that I am constantly learning new things about cultures, beliefs and making new friends. I genuinely feel like all coworkers care about my well being in and outside of work. And they all would do almost anything to get me to smile. They make me feel like I am part of something bigger than myself, while not forgetting that I am an individual that has individual needs. That gives me a great reason to come into work each morning. I also have never heard of a company that takes care of their employees so well. From food, to appreciation gifts, to excellent insurance, to 401k benefits, I am always surprised to find a little bit more while I am at work. I also love the responsibilities and challenges that are given me. If I accomplish something well, I feel I am recognized for that and then given additional opportunities to prove myself.</pros>
<cons>Cons – One of the things that surprised me most when I started working here is the hierarchy of the company. Having never worked in corporate environment before, I did not know what I was getting into. Truthfully, it still intimidates me. I would rather feel like the management was more approachable instead of too busy to say hi when they walked through my office.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I feel like there is a disconnect between what happens within each of our buildings, almost as if they were a part of different worlds, not part of the same world. I know what my job is and how it affects our customers, but what does everyone else do, and what impact do they have? How does my job affect them?Also, concerning, my con listed above. As I have gotten to know certain executives, and managers, I have not felt like they were too busy to acknowledge me. So my suggestion is to provide more opportunities for employees to get to know their executives on a personal level.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com: Canon Fodder for your Resume--THAT'S ALL THOUGH”

</title><pros>Pros – It looks good on a resume... OR at least it did when I left. Being able to work at what appears to be a industry leader for a couple year and make contributions looks good for future employers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Oh where to begin...1. Senior Management live in their own world completely oblivious to what is going on in reality.  They are completely disconnected from the "worker bees" who really make the magic happen.2. You might be an expert in your field, but Senior Management DOES NOT CARE.  They are the VP's so they know best in their opinion.  Despite most having no formal training or experience in the field they are managing.3.  Continuing with the theme, the nepotistic nature of the company, means that if you know someone and suck up enough you might get promoted to a position you hardly deserve. That leaves the rest of us wondering on a daily basis why and how these decision are made.4. You are expected to be perfect.  If you make a small mistake you could be fired so that the senior management can make an example, or appear to be handling the situation.  This leads to people working in constant fear, and lying when they do make mistakes to avoid being a target.  The irony being that if someone at the lowest level makes a mistake, it can be traced to the very top, and the faults of the management being the ultimate culprit.5. On the flip side from #4 Senior management can often make mistakes, some costing the company hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, without any consequence.6. Salaries are far from comparable.  Needless to say if you work there or are considering, just look at how much the senior management makes below, and compare that to your salary (that should be a major clue for you): http://bit.ly/pmjWGI7. I could go on, but you get the idea.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There is no point in giving advice.  The ENTIRE senior management team needs to be replaced with people who understand online retail, and can be fiscally responsible to themselves, and their employees.  Until then there isn't a lot of hope here.</advice-to-management>

“Complete nepotism.”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock.com is a great company to list on your resume.  It will teach you to work in an ever-changing work environment and teach you better time management.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They will tell you there are pay scales for each job, but that is a complete lie and you will have people below you on the hierarchy making a higher salary than you.  This is true across the board in every department.  Good people leave because Overstock is not willing to compensate or pay the valuable employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – My advice to management is to pay your employees based off their job title and competency.  Most managers aren't even qualified to be in their positions and you will constantly lose good employees for lack of pay and poor management.</advice-to-management>

“Miserable. Management is driving it into the ground.”

</title><pros>Pros – Pleasant mountain view. Benefits aren't bad.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management has no idea how to run a company and it is embarrassingly obvious to everyone. They are arrogant, even mean. Expect constant knee-jerk decisions and huge directional changes. Managing by fear and threats is common. You'll fear for your job all the time, which is exhausting and toxic. The company is behind in most areas and is getting lapped by its competition. Talented people leave.  It's awful. Don't work here.....you've been warned!</cons>

“Hostile Work Environment”

</title><pros>Pros – Benefits are decent.  Could be better, but at least we have them.  When you know the right people, management is nice to you.  They give you opportunities to grow.  Getting time off approved is not a problem.  For the most part, management is understanding of your life outside of work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you don't know the right people, or if you get on their bad side, work is horrible.  Only one member of senior management is actually qualified for their position.  None of the other members of management have ever had any actual training, let alone a degree.  People with talent at Overstock are downtrodden because management fears they will be replaced by the more qualified individuals.  New ideas are shot down, especially if the person is not well liked.  Opportunities for growth are based upon personal preference rather than actual abilities.  When given the opportunity for growth, no support is given or additional training for skills that would be useful.  Good work is almost never recognized and mistakes are blown out of proportion.  Communication from management is very poor.  Promises are made but never kept.  Bottom line, when you have to go into work and fear for your job everyday because of what you did or did not do, it makes for a hostile work environment.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get some leaders with training, or give the leaders you have training.  Foster talent, don't destroy it.  Make more decisions based on logic and reason rather than emotion.  Respect your employees and then you will gain respect.  Be more involved, make time for the people under you.  Keep promises and keep perspective.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock's downwards spiral”

</title><pros>Pros – Lots of focus on customer service.  Higher pay than average. Friendly enviroment when you work with people at your same level. Lots of information that can be accessed to help your learn more about various fields of business.</pros>
<cons>Cons – First off the company will give you no privacy even at home. They will micro manage you on a daily basis and even monitor your facebook pages to see what you, your friends and family talk about. Overall the company has been going in a downwards spiral. When you start your employement here you get this idea of this family friendly, understanding, open door enviroment but as you progress throughout the company you gradually learn how untrue that is. A lot of vital information is kept from the employees. Management never gives a straight answer to your questions. Job security is always an issue. The company fires a lot of people every year.  Their is a lot of chaos going on behind the veil that they drape over the newer employees. Too much pressure gets put on the frontline reps to improve but no solid answers are given as to what specifically needs to improve. Lots of negative leads and managers. Quality and training seem to have lost touch with the fun and positivity that used to be a major part of their jobs. You will constantly feel stressed at work and it easily effects your home/personal life. If you move up in the company you will get less recognition and be removed from any and all fun activities. People in higher positions deter people from moving up because they are extremely unhappy with their jobs.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more prevelant in the workforce. Get new people in management positions. There are a lot of people who have hit the roof for advancement in their careers. As the company grows so should the amount of managers you have running various departments. My advice would be to have 2 managers one over specialty and one over frontline. Get some new faces in management. Provide more incentives accross the board and recognize hardwork more often. The company has always fallen behind in making people feel valued and recognizing it right away. Dont restriict certain employees from the incentives if you allow trainers, qa coaches and leads to get the awards you provide it pushes people to move up in the company and get to that position.</advice-to-management>

“Young, inept executives make it a miserable place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – There are some very nice people at Overstock.com and a few who actually understand retail and have some experience outside of the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Patrick Byrne has insulated himself with a young, inexperienced senior leadership team that has no vision for the future.  Decisions are all reactive instead of proactive and the company feels more like a vanity project for Patrick Byrne than a publicly traded company with responsibility to its shareholders.  Most people with outside experience end up being unhappy because the company is so poorly managed.  Ideas for improving systems, proccesses or structure are not welcome.  If you want to keep you job just put your head down and do what you are told even if it is detremental to the business and creates no value for shareholders.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Employees with key responsibilities that affect company performance are rarely measured on their actual contribution to the bottom line.The matrix organization allows for multiple hands in each cookie jar, but not every hand is accountable for the best outcome, which makes decision making and execution difficult.Certain processes such as pricing and compensation have a bias towards mediocrity.  Outperformers are not appropriately rewarded  and sometimes discouraged to meet the norm.Employees tasked with administrative responsibilities are often unmotivated.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Revamp the compensation matrix to measure and appropriately reward each employee's contribution to the company.

“The truth about Overstock”

</title><pros>Pros – Over the last couple of years Overstock has had a reasonable work environment.  They generally give you time-off when you need it.  Most team leads are knowledgeable, and have had a fair about of experience before being promoted to team lead.  The company is going fast, I hope they don't grow too fast and not be able to handle the growth with system/backend support.  The current benefits are good, but we may be headed down a bad road going forward.</pros>
<cons>Cons – - LOTS of red tape.The good:  You go through the process of figuring out your requirements, go through the planning process.  Business approves all requirements and design.  You start coding and are ready to deploy.The Bad: Along comes architecture/upper IT and they say NO we don't like it.  We want you to do it differently.- Not enough hardware and deploy support to handle the number of dev teams in the company.- Interview process and interviewee acceptanceWe want the best there is, but I think we can be slightly less judgmental on who we pick.  Allow someone that isn't so set in their ways.  We have a very strong development team, so get people that we can work with and help mold them.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – - More hardware and deploy support.- Take the time to get rid of technical debt.- Use the reviews to actually give credit where credit is due.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – 1) There is a very clear separation between departments and collaboration is somewhat limited.  In turn, if a merchandising team gets a great deal and purchases it, the marketing team doesn't necessarily create a marketing promotion around it.  Instead, marketing creates promotions and appropriate product is then selected.2) There is an incredible "buddy buddy" system at Overstock.com.  Like the rest of the world, it's very much about who you know that can help one move within the company.3) The timeframe in which communication spreads throughout the company is weak.  In turn, often employees are finding out about key changes at the same time as non-employees which is often after the fact.4) There is some lack of respect for some executives as they seem to know little about what's truly occuring in pieces of the business but have not problems swiftly making changes.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You make work an enjoyable place to come to each day as there is a sense of family within Overstock.com.  Continue to share information to your employees, and they will feel the need to work harder for the company and you.  In a 24-7 business, it's hard to slow down and really hear what is going on, but it makes a difference to the person speaking.  Speaking and feeling as through your voice is being heard are two different things.  You do a great job of listening to our customers and seeking out their feedback.  You should try to do a bit more of this internally with employees.  Overall, it's a great place to work, and I have/would recommend Overstock.com to those I know and meet.</advice-to-management>

“I am not sure what is needed here.”

</title><pros>Pros – Overstock prides itself on being a customer service-oriented company that helps consumers save money. The atmosphere is fairly fun and yet professional. On a personal level I look forward to seeing my co-workers and being at work every day. I think my manager and others over me are interested in utilizing my skills and ultimately promoting me.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I've never seen a company that waffles so much on so many issues. Several promises made to me have not been fulfulled. I feel I am not evaluated on all key aspects of my position (and therefore not fairly) and the pay is downright lousy--I cannot live on this entry-level salary, even with roommates.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to what your employees are telling you. Set performance standards at a reasonable level that takes in quality and not just quantity. Think of how each position can benefit the company as a whole, not just as a department. View the website as a consumer would, not as a business person would--see things through customers' eyes. Overall, a lot of you managers rock!</advice-to-management>

“Overall”

</title><pros>Pros – The people are easy to get along with. Rewards are given to company employees. We can decorate for holidays. Easy to come in to work, some people dred going to work because of various reasons but it is easy to show up every day.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There's not enough parking spaces to accomodate all the employees on a full staff. They end up asking us to move our cars if we're not parked in a valid parking space, and the only other spaces available are on the other side of the building. This is hard to deal with if it's snowing or raining.There is no cieling other than the roof(which is tin) and when it's raining or hailing it's almost too loud to hear the customers.There is not a weatherized smoking area.The dress code is a little too strict for a casual working area. A man is not allowed to wear shorts because they want him to go home and change while a girl is wearing a tank top and flip flops. Even though all of the above are against dress code it should be enforced equally.The stress load can get a little overwhelming around Christmas. I have found myself wishing I could have a vacation to go see my family as they are out of town but I can't as I usually workt he day before and after christmas.Employee Club-O does not give us enough of a discount to be inclined to order from our own website. The 5% discount isn't enough to even cover taxes most times so it's almost like there's no percentage off at all. Free shipping is always good though.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I love working for Overstock.com. Sometimes it is discouraging to submit the employee of the month survey and see the traits of the people that were nominated that do not even surpass the work you do yourself. I also noticed that many of the previous EOMs are people that are not on the phones.When we have Customer Service week I have seen some people winning stuff 2, 3, even 4 times. I feel like my chances are lower if previous winners are still eligible to win again.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com”

</title><pros>Pros – Decent pay and benefits. Great work environment. VERY diverse staffing. No one is rejected from hire due to race, appearance( tattooes piercings etc) or sexual orientation.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Biggest issue in my opinion is new hires being given "instant" promotions to supervisor ,quality or training positions and people with seniority and who are much better qualified are passed over. It is quite frustrating to those who have been employed here for some time to see people who are brand new and do not know what they are doing put directly into higher positions.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – People should have to be in a front line position for at least 6 months before they are allowed to be on quality ,escalations or any of the specialty teams.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com - I love working here.”

</title><pros>Pros – 1) Exciting work environment.  My contributions can quickly be seen in the bottom line of the company.2) Great people.  (Truly!  I know.  I've work at several large companies and Overstock.com has great people.  Friendly, professional, knowledgeable and willing to share that knowledge for the good of the company and everyone's professional growth.  It's like Google but in Utah.)3) Cool technology == professional satisfaction and growth.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Too long of a waiting period before being able to contribute to 401k program.  However, the 401k benefit is generous.What is the waiting period at other companies?  Maybe I have a misperception of what constitutes 'too long of a waiting period''?</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I love my job at Overstock.com.  It's been a while since I could say that about a place where I've worked.  Thank you Overstock.com</advice-to-management>

“Software tester”

</title><pros>Pros – You are given lots of opportunities to learn new tools and receive needed training.  I enjoy the flexibility that the teams are given in getting their projects done.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They only have one company party during the year.Trying to get to any of their buildings by public transportation is extremely difficult.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The prediction market program the company has set up in a joke.  Everything they want us to predict is a financial question.  As a regular employee, I have no idea about the financials of the company.  That gives certain people in the company a huge advantage! The worst part is giving the monthly winner a $1000 gift card. Instead of spending the $4600 each month on 20 "special" employees, why not use that money and throw a party for everyone!</advice-to-management>

“Satisfied”

</title><pros>Pros – Fun and fast-paced!  Plenty of work to do - never bored!  Relaxed, yet hard-working environment that encourages others to get involved.  Management places a lot of trust in the different teams and I feel that encourages active involement on their parts.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lots of reporting that could be consolidated as well as made more actionable.  The on-boarding process for new hires could be more detailed and better illustrated - with all of the vernacular that is unique to Overstock it can be a steep learning curve for some resulting in delayed hiring effectiveness for the company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Praise in public, Reprimand in private.  Small benefits (free lunch, Overstock store, etc) are great!  Working in cross-functional teams helps others understand the obstacles and delays experienced in other areas and can too help develop better solutions to these various issues.  Most importantly, continue to smile and have fun!!  (oh yeah - and a company ski team would be totally rad)</advice-to-management>

“Overstock is a good company to work for.”

</title><pros>Pros – Coworkers are for the most part friendly and work hard. The people in the analytic portion of the company are very intelligent and are constantly coming up with unique ways of improving the business. The corporate culture is one of smart, casual people that work hard. It is a great company to work for that is on the cutting edge of online retail.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is just okay. I know of many people that are using Overstock as a springboard to gain experience in a tough economy and then planning on moving on to better opportunities as they come available. This is really too bad because it is sad to loose intelligent people and be forced to then have to try to replace them. If Overstock was willing to pay 10-20% more they would hold on to some of these good people and cut down on the replacement costs of having to train someone new.Also, starting with two weeks of PTO (that includes both optional days off and sick days) for your first year is challenging. That increases to three weeks your second year, but most companies start with a minimum of 3 weeks.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Give people a solid reason to stay with Overstock. Make the pay and the benefits such that you not only attract the best people, but hold on to them.</advice-to-management>

“Overstock.com, a great place to work!”

</title><pros>Pros – Promotion from within. Good opportunities to grow professionally. They are always looking at new technologies that can help the company technically and sales wise.

“Don't speak up - or else”

</title><pros>Pros – It's close to home, nice atmosphere, not many cubicles where I work.  Ummm... the vending machines are nice.  There is a water fountani and a river out back.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you speak up, you will pay for it.  The pay sucks compared to other companies of the same size, location, etc.  If you want to be promoted, you'd better make sure it comes with more pay, because if you don't, you won't get more pay.  They play like they like you, but that's only because you're a "butt" in a seat.  One senior Vp who has a stormy name makes a habit of firing people in front of others to make an example of them.  She even wanted one employee's parents present at her firing.  Are you kidding me?</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – The people are great. The benefits are good. The learning of different aspects of the company and its workings, leadership courses, cross training and can’t forget “O” University.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Slow to give rises, promotions, and bonuses went down. Economy has been bad but it's been bad for the regular worker too. With growth in knowledge of all aspects of the workings of the work site and more responsibilities there is a short in matching money with skills and abilities. Hopefully 2010 will be better.</cons>

“Great training opportunity's poor physical working conditions.”

</title><pros>Pros – The company has been doing an excellent job of providing relevant and useful training.  The technologies we use are current and will help improve my useful skill set, and resume.  We are working on projects that matter to the company's bottom line which is nice.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Their personal time off/sick pay/holiday pay schedule is very poor, and you cannot accrue more time off with increasing tenure.The physical working conditions are very unprofessional as they are removing all cubicle walls and putting people in rows of desks that are lined up touching side to side back to back.  So in the room I work in we will have over 100 people in rows of desks so your desk backs up on some one else's desk and your desk is touching the two desks next to it.  We are loosing all of our white boards, which are necessary for working out some software engineering problems.  This arrangement would not be bad if you had one small team in a bull pen type area with white boards but when you have over 100 people in a single room with no white boards the noise, and visual distraction level becomes unbearable.  This will have the effect of destroying all team communication/colaboration, kill all personal focus and creativity, as people fight constant distractions</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – If you want people to stay, and be productive I would suggest you improve the working conditions, and give people more time off, and allow them to accrue more time off with increasing tenure.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Coworkers are very fun, friendly, and diverse. Products on website are fairly interesting. Frequent hiring because of employee turnover.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Company in general has little respect for employees. Frequent schedule changes with little (1-2 business day) notice. Shared computers with other employees. No personal or secure storage at desk. Everyone in customer service is hired as a temp (no benefits, no holidays) even if you are hired for a specific permanent position. Company won't pay for time it takes for employee to log into computer and log into time keeping website every day. Employees penalized for being sick, even with H1N1 warnings posted everywhere. No employee discount. HR uses only paper employment applications (which they frequently lose).</cons>
