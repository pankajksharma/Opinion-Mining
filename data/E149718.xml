“A quality place to stand still.”

</title><pros>Pros – It's a quality-oriented business giving its highest priority to customer satisfaction.  It feels good to work for such an organization, especially if you are a quality-oriented person.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There seems to be very little organized job orientation and/or training.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Take some courses in management skills.  Try to treat employees like you want them to improve and advance in their jobs and move "up the ladder", even if the wait to step up a rung is a long one.  Really listen to employees, and don't always think any idea other than your own is wrong.</advice-to-management>
