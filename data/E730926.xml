“Fantastic Training and Experience - Poor Company Culture from the Top Down”

</title><pros>Pros – as a sales associate, you can be a person - not a sales person. Fantastic Training and experience. The top sales manager is extremely intelligent about sales and is helpful in keeping you on top of your game.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Managers try to micro manage every single aspect of your work. Because they try to take on too much they are unable to effectively control the workplace in a positive way- this leads to incredible amounts of negativity among the staff and a relatively high turnover rate.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
