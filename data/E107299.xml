<title>

“Learned alot, great resume builder with diverse and interesting projects, but company needs to mature.”

</title><pros>Pros – Huge variety of projects.  Very involved work.  Direct control over project outcome.  Very flat management structure.   Innovation is generally welcome and seen as an accomplishment rather than a problem.  Work with major companies providing services.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Immature software processes, lack of in-house software products.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Having more in-house products would wean the company off of depending on service contracts to make money.  Paying more attention to tool-chain, rapid development, and developing maintainable solid products rather than concentrating on speed will help in the future.</advice-to-management>
