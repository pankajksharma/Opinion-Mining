“it is quite good enough”

</title><pros>Pros – it is quite good in terms of salary for being a first time here in saudi. it has good benefits. regarding plumbing works al-shiha is the number 1 plumbing company here in eastern province of saudi arabia.</pros>
<cons>Cons – well sometimes it is not quite good enough regarding the needs of the workers because sometimes they don't give what they need specially in tools that will be used in the site. some workers buy their own tools but this are cheap tools and you can buy in your own but as you can see this must be provided by the company whether it is expensive or cheap.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please take good care of your workers and understand what their needs because they are working for the good quality of works for a good performance of the company in the market.</advice-to-management>
