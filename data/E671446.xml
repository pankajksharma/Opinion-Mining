“"Fun place to work!"”

</title><pros>Pros – Fun, energetic environment.  Work hard, play hard kind of place.  Great support to community and employs many disabled workers.  Really great values and ethics as an overall company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Office set up in an open concept (which is great most of the time), but you don't have any privacy at all and it is loud for a position who is on the phone all the time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
