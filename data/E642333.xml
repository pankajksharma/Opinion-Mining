“Demanding but rewarding company”

</title><pros>Pros – Many new ideas were appropriately taken into considered when brought up.  Compensation was above average and potential for growth was very good.  People in organization are very skilled and dedicated to their craft.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The senior management staff is very closed lipped and can tend to speak out of both sides of their mouths.  The CEO is demanding but I never learned as much from a manager as I did from him.  It is a shame that the senior team below him makes you feel so left out.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
