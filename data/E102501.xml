“The neutral rating for this review is the result of five years of backsliding from excellent.”

</title><pros>Pros – Wagner is an employee-owned corporation.  We have goo computer facilities and administrative support for a small company, and hire only PhD and post graduate qualified and professional staff.Big bonus is private offices for all employees and we are located in suburban residential communities near major universities and in world centers for high technology R&D.  All technical staff receive one week professional leave with a generous allowance for books, journals, and society memberships.</pros>
<cons>Cons – One or two rainmakers, and management communication is often lacking.  There can be an overwhelming sensation of stagnation.</cons>
