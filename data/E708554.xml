“A nice "family" feel to working here”

</title><pros>Pros – Good technical and product training - they expect you to know your store and the product range, but give you opportunities to learn about them. Management style was friendly and approachable. A lot of team spirit in the store I worked, which made it feel good to come to work. Salaries comparable to others in this market.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Shift pattern can be an issue to work/life balance depending on the department worked; in one department my hours were changed every week, and so it was difficult to plan ahead more than a week at a time</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep on treating your staff like people, and you will keep on getting good results form them.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
