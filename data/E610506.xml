“Wonderful, energetic atmosphere that fosters world class service and the love of stationary in all its staff”

</title><pros>Pros – - Benefits are unique and well integrated to performance- Complete training is given and you are supported the entire time- Great company policy focusing on world class service so you get to serve happy customers who also love kikki.k!- Really great team atmosphere and lovely people to work with</pros>
<cons>Cons – - You do really have to love the product in order to fit with the organizational culture- I see these as a good things but you do have performance reviews and are given valuable feedback regularly and you will have targets and goals to aim for and ideally reach. If you don't reach them you will be given support and training to help you!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
