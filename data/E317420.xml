<title>

“Great and unique work environment, opportunity, and personal growth.”

</title><pros>Pros – The people you work with are not only talented, sharp individuals, but they quickly become like family. The system of promotion is very fair, but also challenging enough to force personal development. Competitive work environment. Demands your best. The room for opportunity is endless. Very fast passed, many co-workers were promoted to management in several months. Hard work does not go unnoticed. Travel is also a great time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Initial pay is not great. However, if you make the most of the opportunity and gain assistant or manager status, commissions almost double and a very very generous salary is added as well. The field can also be a challenge but when promoted you will be in an office ( your own even) soon enough. Weather can be rough too. Long hours but they usually fly by.</cons>
