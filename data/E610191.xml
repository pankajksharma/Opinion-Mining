“Be Prepared to Kiss A**”

</title><pros>Pros – Small company, good vacation, often get off early on Fridays before a holiday.  Partners in company are very nice.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Little opportunity for growth.  No opportunity for advancement - supervisors were hired in that way and not likely to go anywhere anytime soon.  Office manager is very old fashioned and unprofessional.  Those that kiss ass keep their jobs.  Be prepared to be reprimanded for the same things that your supervisor does, but she'll get away with it.  Pay is poor and everyone gets the same raises.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Pay is not comparable to other companies with similar positions.  Benefits are not good.  Appreciation of your staff would go a long way.</advice-to-management>
