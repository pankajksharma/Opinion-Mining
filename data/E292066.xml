“When the economy changed, the job changed with more work, less hours, no appreciation for hard work and long hours”

</title><pros>Pros – You do not have to work weekends, nice employees other than management, work environment is nice, and the all the doctors are great to work for.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low pay, poor benefits. they have a 401 K but they do not match anything, health insurance sucks, long hours, no recognition, no bonuses, no nothing but misery.  It is a horrible place to work unless you like to get scolded in front of other people, work long, long hours in a day. They are only out for themselves and it is all about the magic word, MONEY!!! They are scam artists and do every test imagninabl on patients whether they need it or not.   Management plays favorites. They are cheap, no raises, no nothing...Like management says "Be glad you have a job"....</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It would be nice to be recoginzied for the hard work everyone does, especially the medical assistants and nurses,  even if it was only a thank you. That would cost them nothing.</advice-to-management>
