“Very fullfilling, I was party of a team taking care of soldiers, heros and veterans. It was an honor to work there.”

</title><pros>Pros – The staff are very friendly, and helpful. They are a VERY team oriented work environment that also take care of their employees wether or not they are in the service. Federal Health Employee benefits can't be beat.They have a full time medical resiliencey staff member on site to help you relax in his "Relaxation/decompression room". So if you are stressed, you can listen to some soothing meditaion type music and watch fish swimming in a tank while relaxing in a massage chair in a dim room, can't beat that to help cope with daily stress even if it is from home life!!!</pros>
<cons>Cons – At times the hours can be long, it is in a small community so there aren't to many things to do after work if you are used to the big city life.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep up the good work, it was an honor working there. The senior leaders are top notch, the OIC of the clinic I worked in really cares about her staff and patients. She helped me out a great deal making my transition from the Military to being an Army Civilian a great deal less stressful. I wish I could submitt the OIC of Physical Therapy an impact award (AAM, ARCOM) for her srevice, compassion, and careing for me and my family!! Hoooya</advice-to-management>
