“A place to start to learn about commercial real estate finance.”

</title><pros>Pros – Asset managers are encouraged to work with analysts and associates to help them gain exposure to higher-level responsibilities.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Limited room for professional growth unless you manage to get a transfer to another division.  Most of the work involved in primary servicing seem to revolve around Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac pre-securitized (warehouse) assets so your experience will be almost entirely on multifamily assets.  If you are looking for exposure on analyzing different asset classes (office/retail, hotel, warehouse, industrial, etc.)  you will not find that here unless you are in the CDO primary servicing group.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Continue to expand on protege' program, so that analysts and associates can eventually rotate through a 2-3 year program that includes primary and special servicing.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>

“Great experience!”

</title><pros>Pros – Solid vision from the top guys and great execution so far. Fast paced and fast growing company that was a pleasure to work for. The majority of the people that work there are very smart and hard working, but know how to have a fun time as well.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You could probably go to a more 'Wall Street' type firm and earn a bit more in salary, but you'll be giving up the work-life balance that C3 offers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
