“Boutique Private Banking”

</title><pros>Pros – U-bank is a boutique bank, offering wealth management services. As u-bank is a part of FIBI group, it has the privilege to "tailor made" adjustments. There are about 200 employees in u-bank, about 100 are spread out in the various branches, and the other 100 are in the hq in Tel Aviv. Do to is size, u-bank is kind of a family :)</pros>
<cons>Cons – u-bank's publicity is not very known... There for, as an employee you will not be able to enjoy and use it's Brand Name as a strong quality.</cons>
