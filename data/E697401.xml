<title>

“Generally a fine place to work if you don't expect to earn too much”

</title><pros>Pros – Good environmet, great people, good for the resume, transparent institution with all benefits mandated by law and some extras</pros>
<cons>Cons – The salary is about average to all CR private universities... wich means you can hardly expect to make a much of a living out of it. If you are a good professional, you probably have other better paid options. On the other hand, that's not specific to ULACIT, but to most private universities here.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
