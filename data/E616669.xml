“A "Green Architecture" office with a family-like atmosphere”

</title><pros>Pros – A good reputation, very patient , nice and knowledgeable bosses that have amazing stories to share, homely environment, convenient location with lovely surroundings. I felt a very good connection with the entire staff, and the boss's personal assistant is absolutely adorable.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The office is demanding availability to various public contests and tenders. Sometimes the work can be challenging and even difficult. At times, I found it rather hard to balance between my personal life and my professional one.</cons>
