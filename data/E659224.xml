“Wrong Work Approach”

</title><pros>Pros – Employees can directly discuss with Director</pros>
<cons>Cons – No planning at all. Employees have to work on different projects in a single day, because of this, employees cannot concentrate on work. Working hours are very long and employees are forced to stay and work late night several times. Seniors always use to blame on their juniors for every mistake. Working environment is not good.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
