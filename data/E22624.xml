“Internships, Contractor or Vendor...don't take a FT position!”

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible work is possible if you have a family. Some smart people, a few decent clients. You will learn by doing because you will have no choice. Owners seem to care for the people who have been there for a while. Nice location in downtown Walnut Creek.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No leadership. Principals want to evolve their services, but use subs for almost everything. They do not walk their talk to potential clients. If you are over 30 and don't act like the younger kids, you will be out of the loop. They take longs lunches, come in late, go for coffee, go for yogurt, go shopping, walk with the others even when they don't want to get coffee. If they work 4 hours daily, it's a big day.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hire salespeople under 40. Retire or sell. Clean out half of the lazy staff. Pay people better so you can justify telling them to actually work. Get some real management in place where processes are documented and enforced.</advice-to-management>
