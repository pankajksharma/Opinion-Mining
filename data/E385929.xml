“Unprofessional and misogynistic”

</title><pros>Pros – Good learning experience in the food and dining industry</pros>
<cons>Cons – The management do not encourage their staff at all. Definitely utilizes the practice of favoritism well. I did not feel that there was potential for growth. One of the managers also continually crossed the line with the female staff.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Learn how to listen actively to the concerns of your employees. Learn how to make your staff feel important so they can relay that energy back to the customers. Learn how to use positive reinforcement from time to time so employees are motivated to grow and challenge themselves. Most importantly, please act professional at all times.</advice-to-management>
