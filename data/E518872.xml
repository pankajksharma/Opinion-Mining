“Most conducive atmosphere to learn and work in transcription.”

</title><pros>Pros – The environment in which we work is enjoyable. The interaction between transcriptionists and the middle management is very friendly. The facilities are many to spend when some free time is available. The prospects for growth are many.</pros>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The reason for reducing the number off per month was that there was no coverage for the weekends. The management could have asked employes to present at least one Saturday and one Sunday per month could have solved this problem, but the management did not consider this.</advice-to-management>
