“Small "Family" IT Telecoms Billing company with all the small Irish family company faults”

</title><pros>Pros – Work with lots of Telecoms companies around the world with possible travel. Flexible hours with late starts. Salary very good.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Family members favoured within the company. Unstable employment, lots of regular firing when money is tight. Senior Management often "Tired and emotional" when in the office. Focus is on good life for "family" members rather than growing the company. Limited future in their niche area of Interconnect Billing / Route Optimization.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Soberiety at least one or two days a week.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
