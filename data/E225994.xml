“Can be a great place to build experience and connections”

</title><pros>Pros – The people at D Magazine Partners really make the place great. You'll love the diversity and personalities and the relaxed working atmosphere. Great holidays; scheduled and open. Definitely a place to learn and express new ideas. Work life balance is good to normal. Benefits are good for the size of the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some positions have a very limited ceiling for advancement. Depending on position, there can be severe competition and demand to perform. No standardized vacation plan. No 401K matching.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Annual reviews which tie to personal and professional advancement and/or compensation. A more standardized vacation policy to encourage better work life balance. Improved Community involvement. Improved personal development and professional security plans.</advice-to-management>

“A great work environment but there's very little room for growth”

</title><pros>Pros – The environment is fast-paced, fun and creative. And the people are absolutely wonderful! There are also a lot of perks including tickets to events, entrance to high-profile parties, etc.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company is small enough that there's very little room to grow. There's no type of incentive programs like bonuses or salary raises and they don't contribute to 401k's.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It's so important for management to make sure that their employees feel appreciated. Expecting excellence and hard work is one thing but expecting employees to work 60-70+ hours a week is unfair and will eventually drive people away.</advice-to-management>

“Great learning experience, dynamic environment,”

</title><pros>Pros – The company has great people, and an even greater brand!  It was so rewarding being able to provide effective advertising for my clients.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Could be viewed as a sorority- there was a lot of gossip.   Constantly decreasing commission for one reason or another...and when the position is 100% commission it's definitely noticed.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Increase positive reinforcement, praise, and acknowledgment of successes for individuals and the team.  Also, eliminate the yearly "slight" decrease in compensation structure.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>

“I have never been more disappointed in an employer in my entire life.”

</title><pros>Pros – D Magazine has great brand recognition within the Dallas community.  People get excited when they find out that you work for D Magazine.  It's opens doors...which is good because you will need doors to be opened to a new job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Four salespeople make between $200-$400,000 per year.  They have been at the magazine for 8+ years and they won't be leaving...ever.  They have a monopoly on all of the businesses in Dallas who can afford to advertise in D Magazine.  Everyone else takes their scraps for leads and starves.  It is almost impossible to get a job here.  They interviewed 20 people before they hired me.  You have to pass a test called TREGO that is similar to the SAT's.  It took me 3 hours to take and only 1 in every 5 people will pass it.  You expect there to be a lot potential with with the job because it is so hard to get hired and they start you out at a $35,000 draw earning 10% commission until you meet your draw.  Then you can make 20% commission.  What they don't tell you is that it is impossible to meet your draw due to the businesses that you are allowed to contact.  The top 25 businesses in every category is already taken and no one else is going to be able to afford D Magazine.  You will starve!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management already knows how to correct my cons.</advice-to-management>
