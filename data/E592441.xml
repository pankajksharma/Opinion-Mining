“Even if its good, never get too comfortable”

</title><pros>Pros – Employers were willing to work with my volunteer schedule and allowed me to make my work environment comfortable and visually appealing. Gave great constructive instruction, history and  very pleasant environment to work in.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They became disgruntle when I made the decision to move to another state and have seemingly gave misleading recommendations to my future employment opportunities. Since I had NO negative reviews, reprimands and only positive feedback and constructive direction. I felt very betrayed from the working relationship we had.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It may have been a disappointment and not the ending of a working relationship that we all had expected but creating issues for the future employment wasn't morally right.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
