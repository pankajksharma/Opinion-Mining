“My experience at Edelman has been both fun and educational.”

“DRANK THE COOL-AID, YOU BETTER TOO”

</title><pros>Pros – Love my job at the factory of Edelmans - my name and what i do there isn't important and why should it be - i was given my number on day one and that is what i was called - i love being in a factory setting - anonymous - i can be at my desk like hundreds of other edel-robots</pros>
<cons>Cons – there really isn't much cons to Edelman - oh, I forgot, is it a 'CON' when they promise you one thing and then deliver on something else - when upper management in the NYC consumer group turns over faster then you change your bed sheets - or that over servicing of clients is the norm - and not even frowned upon -</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please provide more cool-aid in the fun healthy snack cart that you tout as a perk for working there event though every item is 50 cents -</advice-to-management>

“Solid opportunities to learn and teach.”

</title><pros>Pros – Can't say enough good things about the culture at Edelman. It's something everyone seems to believe in and team members are eager to teach to new employees.The network is an asset, but it's also because the network is very open to engaging one another and helping where assistance is needed. You can shoot an email to someone in another office and before you know it, someone in an office across country or even the ocean has responded provided info with the you need.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Whether you're in a large office or small office, it's take a little more time/effort to get your work recognized. People are always willing to help, but there are A LOT of people, so selling your results and your office's results to Edelman at large can be difficult.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>

“A place to stay and grow”

</title><pros>Pros – Fantastic colleagues, challenging work. Edelman provides an environment where employees can get out as much as they put in -- opportunities to chart your own career path, propose new approaches to client challenges and travel to other offices through fellowship programs. We work hard but there is plenty of time to enjoy, as well.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Communication and cooperation could be better across teams and practice areas. In some cases, too much focus on individual P&Ls vs. the good of the client or company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Continue to enforce teamwork across groups and offices to reduce the "look out for yourself" or "what in it for me" mentality.</advice-to-management>

“All the potential in the world for a career, but need the right mentor.”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has an extremely collaborative culture; a global mindset that allows for mobility where the business dictates and your aspirations lie.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You need a strong manager as your advocate to open doors; not everyone has that and it can be hindering. As you get to the most senior ranks, significant opportunity to own something gets muddled in a large office.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Upbeat company culture, senior staff will invest time and resources in you, hard work is recognized and usually rewarded, great brands to work on and sharpen your PR skills</pros>
<cons>Cons – 40+ hour work weeks are more often the rule than the exception. even if your plate is full it's not unusual to have more work added.</cons>

“Edelman is like heaven compared to my past experiences!”

</title><pros>Pros – Work with incredibly smart, hard working and fun people who are dedicated to providing clients with the best work, and enjoying a work/life balance, and get paid fairly for your hard work. It is a large company, so that means you have a lot of national and international resources at your fingertips.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is a large company, so if you happen to have a shy personality, it may take a long time to get noticed by senior management.</cons>

“Progressive company where an entrepreneurial spirit is encouraged and rewarded.”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman's culture attracts incredibly talented, driven and entrepreneurial people, so you're surrounded by some of the industry's brightest minds every day. On top of that, Edelman's vast network allows you to connect with experts across the globe for strategic counsel and insights for the most niche situations.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Agency life is all about client service and therefore a very demanding environment where you're often putting the needs of the business in front of your own. This is not an environment for the faint of heart or anyone unwilling to role up their sleeves and get the work done.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Team managers need to be held accountable for their actual managerial skills, not just their client facing skills, as that's where I have seen the biggest area of opportunity regarding retention and employee morale.</advice-to-management>

“The best in the business”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is hands down the best PR firm in the business.  I've been with the company for more than 10 years and worked at 4 other firms before joining Edelman, so I know what I'm talking about.  Edelman's independence, entrepreneurial spirit, prudent risk-taking, thought leadership and commitment to quality differentiate it from other agencies, particularly those that are owned by huge holding companies.  It is the iconic communications firm of the 21st century.  I've never wanted to leave Edelman because I've always been able to find my next career challenge within the firm.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As it gets bigger, internal politics is becoming more of an issue (although it's still nothing like the other firms I've worked at).  There is also a tendency for the firm to take on too many new internal initiatives at once, which puts a burden on employees who are trying to keep their clients happy.  Until recently, serious bad behavior within the very senior ranks seemed to be tolerated. This appears to be changing but the jury is still out.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more selective about the internal initiatives you roll out within a given timeframe.  Make sure they're all business-critical and not too many are launched at the same time.  Get tougher on bad behavior, particularly at the top.</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – New client work is always welcome, but acknowledge when someone is already spread too thin especially when they communicate it. And when you say extra help is on it way, please actually deliver on that.</advice-to-management>

“Edelman is like heaven compared to my past experiences!”

</title><pros>Pros – Work with incredibly smart, hard working and fun people who are dedicated to providing clients with the best work, and enjoying a work/life balance, and get paid fairly for your hard work. It is a large company, so that means you have a lot of national and international resources at your fingertips.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is a large company, so if you happen to have a shy personality, it may take a long time to get noticed by senior management.</cons>

“Progressive company where an entrepreneurial spirit is encouraged and rewarded.”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman's culture attracts incredibly talented, driven and entrepreneurial people, so you're surrounded by some of the industry's brightest minds every day. On top of that, Edelman's vast network allows you to connect with experts across the globe for strategic counsel and insights for the most niche situations.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Agency life is all about client service and therefore a very demanding environment where you're often putting the needs of the business in front of your own. This is not an environment for the faint of heart or anyone unwilling to role up their sleeves and get the work done.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Team managers need to be held accountable for their actual managerial skills, not just their client facing skills, as that's where I have seen the biggest area of opportunity regarding retention and employee morale.</advice-to-management>

“Fast-paced, strategic thinking, smart people, room to grow”

</title><pros>Pros – I'm fortunate to work with and learn from some of the smartest thinkers in PR. Edelman's size means the company can leverage resources from around the network, around the world. Leadership is constantly thinking of ways to innovate and adapt to a rapidly changing world, and invests in training for employees. Edelman allows employees to move to different groups and pursue client work that matches personal interests and expertise, and also allows employees to transition to new offices around the network, where possible. For most employees, there are plenty of opportunities for promotion and advancement. Dress code is casual. Company is upgrading technology so all employees will have modern laptops and choice of company-provided smartphones.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Like all PR agencies, work is often very fast-paced and employees must juggle multiple projects and client obligations which can be challenging. There is pressure to be "always connected" even on vacations or sick days although management is trying to change this attitude. For most, working remotely on a regular basis is not encouraged.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Explore the possibility of letting employees work from home/remotely on a limited basis. Encourage management to set positive examples of work/life balance.</advice-to-management>

“A great place to learn big-agency PR by working with the best people and clients.”

</title><pros>Pros – Work with top client names like Pfizer, Microsoft, Starbucks. Collegial, very team-oriented environment with tons of smart, energetic people. Many teams have the budget and mandate to use high-dollar or edgy PR tactics. The company really does value its people and offers a wide array of fringe benefits, from free fruit and candy to casual dress and a fairly generous vacation policy.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hours can be long and unpredictable. Even if you've got the vacation time, it can be very hard to take it and sometimes work will find you no matter what. Many clients are demanding and some are not nice. Although Edelman tries to be entrepreneurial, there are plenty of people (and clients) who operate as cogs in the machine -- there's often an incentive to do things the way they've always be done. On big accounts, sometimes there are too many layers for junior staff to get much independence and responsibility.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – We have got to find a better way to train our junior staff on taking initiative and pitching media. The big accounts teach a lot in terms of process and scale, but everyone AS and below needs the experience of being on a small account where they personally are accountable to the client and the media or online influencers.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is full of brilliant, innovative minds who impress me with every interaction. At the SAE level, I've been pleasantly surprised by the opportunities I've had to sit in rooms and brainstorm with very senior, extremely bright colleagues.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The hours can be ridiculous and being on the senior side of junior level is really difficult to navigate. Edelman can be a pretty thankless environment so you have to have something that drives you, personally, other than kudos from your team leads.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – - Don't ask questions to which you don't want the answer (i.e. How are you doing? How can I help?)- Say thank you more often and more directly recognize the hard work of your team members.

</title><pros>Pros – Smart people who push you to grow and will help you develop a job into a career. If you're good, they'll be really flexible when you request an account or office change.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Severely underpaid when compared to other digital agencies or in-house opportunities. The SF economy has sky-rocketed in the last 3-4 years and rent has gone with it. Unfortunately, Edelman has not kept up with these increases. For this reason, we lose good people to other jobs quite often. In San Francisco, retaining good talent comes down to pay.

“Cretive space with great people.”

</title><pros>Pros – I love it here - everyone has a voice, and all ideas are encouraged. It's a creative space with great people, and they are very work/life balanced. You can actually have a personal life, too, when you work here.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's still a bit too heavy on the out-of-date PR model, so creatives have two sets of "clients" still. They ARE working on this, however, so i believe this will be different by this time next year.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Working at Edelman has truly been the best career opportunity I've had to date.  My day-to-day is always different, full of challenges and the rewards that come with meeting those difficulties head on.  My colleagues are so smart and engaged, and above all happy.  It's not a culture of complaining, it's a culture of doing, even when the doing isn't all puppies and rainbows.  But with that being said, sometimes my job IS about puppies and rainbows, which is really awesome.  I couldn't be more proud to be in an environment that provides career development and opportunities at all levels.</pros>

</title><pros>Pros – Strong ethics, values and entrepreneurial spirit, family run company, amazing talent and support, great opportunities for professional development, a variety of career paths</pros>
<cons>Cons – My only criticism every year is the size of the annual merit raises. They are tiny. The bonus program is great, but as you rise in the ranks, you're likely to stay at one level for several years, and it doesn't seem right that strong performances are not rewarded monetarily. I also think it can hurt us with retention.</cons>

I came from a job at a studio and it was hell compared to the job here. Edelman truly cares for its employees. MATTER is the best department to work for.</pros>

“Great Work Experience. Experience Great Work.”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is an iconic agency that has all of the benefits and charming quirks of a family-owned business. Even though it built its creds on consumer marketing, it does top-class work in other areas, like corporate and health. Obviously, the agency's digital capabilities are among the best in the industry as well. Getting exposure to all of that at any level adds up to a great work experience. It's also great to be working at a placed considered to be such an "employer of choice" and therefore have great talent from all kinds of levels go to some extraordinary lengths to get hired here. (Like Facebook ads targeting Edelman employees.)</pros>
<cons>Cons – While the agency talks about a relatively "flat" culture where even the most junior person has a say, the message that it consistently promotes internally is "Isn't our senior leadership team JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!?!" Things get _very_ self-congratulatory at the GM level and above, sometimes to the point of causing eye-rolls among the rest of the staff. ("Alright. Alright. We get it, already.") The fact that excellent work was done "under the watch" (though maybe not the active participation) of any particular leader is valued more than the people who actually did that work. Those leaders don't _mean_ to take credit for others' work, it's just that it doesn't really matter to them when that happens. There isn't a whole lot of consistent effort to bring the agency closer to the recruiting message of that "flat" culture. "Town Halls" and that sort of thing don't really cut it.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Let great work speak for itself. Take the time to figure out _how_ things got done and what innovation is taking place outside the circle of a small group of superstars. Broaden your view of the agency beyond a small set of peer-level advisors.</advice-to-management>

“Great reputation, but few long-term employees"”

</title><pros>Pros – Awesome place to start your career and get agency experience from a company that is top-notch. Edelman has the power, the client names and a great CEO. Given that we are private it isn't based on "billability."Better training - Company recently announced Edelman Learning Institute, which shows the company cares about providing professional development for its' employees.Great reputation, when looking at Glassdoor many of the other power players in the large PR agency don't have the same</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman Digital - They receive benefits and perks PR doesn't, like annual retreats and their system for promotions isn't matched to the PR side of things, yet the titles are the same.Transfers - Edelman makes it seem very easy for employees to transfer, but they still have to interview the job and it can take months. Also you cannot use it as promotion opportunity, must transfer at your level. For international transfers, you must be an Account Supervisor. Wish it was more transparent.Politics - Promotions aren't always based on merit, if you associate with the right people you will be promoted faster, even when not deserved.</cons>

“Edelman gave me the opportunity to grow and flourish”

</title><pros>Pros – You get to work with some of the best in the business across various areas of PR, including crisis, digital, consumer, healthcare, etc. I had direct interaction with clients from the first week that I started. Senior employees definitely want junior and mid-level employees to rise quickly, and they empower them to do so. I was given multiple opportunities to own projects from the very beginning, and I love that I get to work with such a passionate group of people on a daily basis. Assert yourself quickly and develop an expertise within your team -- you'll have a much more fulfilling experience that way! Overall, the leadership at Edelman is top-notch, and the values and mission that Richard Edelman set for the firm permeate every level of the business.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The salaries are very low, and I took a significant pay cut to work here. Maintaining a decent work-life balance is ALWAYS a challenge given the nature of the industry and the hours that junior and mid-level employees are expected to work. I regularly clocked 12-hour days for my first few months at the company, and I doubt that I'll ever work less than 10.5 hours/day moving forward.</cons>

“Good clients, difficult agency”

</title><pros>Pros – Some name recognition in the brand, but losing that cache quickly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Too many to list. It's a sinking ship. Management team is a disaster, and that's really a compliment.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The business is heading for a nose dive because they do not invest enough in growing and retaining their talent. PR and marketing firms have employees as their biggest asset -- they can make or break the enterprise. Yet time and again, companies like Edelman get confused that the names of past and current clients are their biggest assets. My advice to management at Edelman is that this current way of operating is too short-sighted. By training and developing your people and caring and investing in them the way an industrial business might maintain a productive machine, Edelman will get far higher dividends than just trying to chase that next big client -- and wearing its people down in the process. The cycle is not sustainable for the business or its people.</advice-to-management>

“Limited growth opportunities, poor compensation, improperly trained managers”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a creative place to work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lower level employees are not treated well, mid-level managers are poorly trained and made supervisors at a young age, advancement opportunities are slim. The few people who were promoted last year had a very slight salary increase -- much lower than the industry average. Turnover is high. Company morale is low. Senior and mid-level management is not doing anything to increase morale. Instead they limit advancement, cut programs and work you to the bone.</cons>

“If you are a minority, look else where”

</title><pros>Pros – Of course Edelman looks great on your resume, it's the largest PR firm in the world. The opportunity seems endless for most.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Minorities, especially those of African decent, do not advance at an equal pace as others. It may take two years to get promoted from a AAE to AE or AE to SAE. Minority interns rarely get hired, extended or even considered. It was also discouraging to see the majority of AA employees working in mail room. This is not an isolated situation, it happens in offices around the country.</cons>

“Best of the PR Agencies, but High Burn Out and Widening Divide between Digital/Traditional PR”

</title><pros>Pros – Of all the PR agencies, Edelman is the best. You aren't going to find a PR agency that is more devoted to pioneering new approaches and evolving rapidly to meet the needs of the market. The Edelman Trust Barometer and online training services are standout resources that go beyond what other agencies offer in terms of market resource and continuing education.While I can't confirm this is absolutely true, Edelman does appear to pay slightly higher than other agencies - at least among junior and mid-level roles.As far as PR training, if you can pick what agency you pick for, Edelman is the best proving ground for building a PR career. Edelman picks which client it works for, and there's a good mix in vertical and client size (start up to major tech company).</pros>
<cons>Cons – There remains a divide in treatment and cooperation between the traditional PR and Digital divisions. Digital appears to get some preferential treatment - promotions tend to come faster and they regularly have off-site retreats where the entire region attends training and networking sessions. This added investment in the Digital side is creating resentment since there does not seem to be any specialty trainings/offerings for the traditional PR side.For general account work, junior and mid-level staff put in LONG hours, which seems to go unnoticed or recognized by senior management. This tends to be the norm in the PR agency world, but Edelman is guilty of burn out among lower level employees as much as the next agency.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There's still ambiguity in Digital vs. Traditional treatment - and this perceived preference toward Digital is creating a lot of resentment across the divisions. Even if these continue, this resentment can be curbed by management being more transparent and proactive in the purpose of these trainings. (Currently it feels like a "hidden secret.")Edelman can be the stand-out agency if senior management pays closer attention to the volume of hours lower level employees put in. Even if unavoidable at time, extra recognition of long hours and elbow grease (on a personal level) can go a long way in keeping morale high. Eliminate this burn out will also help Edelman retain top talent.</advice-to-management>

“Incredibly disappointing.”

</title><pros>Pros – The driven co-workers and wealth of opportunities via Edelman's reputation.The (very few) passionate co-workers.The exceptional senior management that offered an intern opportunities and encouraged creativity, strategy and ideation from a junior-level, temporary employee.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Don't expect to be welcomed here -- this office does not like new competition (i.e. me, an intern) or even their own clients (evidenced by immature account supervisors calling them names daily). Don't expect to be respected, either. No one cares about an intern's ideas -- even if they are relevant (save some upper management) -- or even their basic needs. This office is experiencing growing pains and needs to figure out what their office philosophy truly is vs. what they think it is...HR is in need of some re-vamping, too. I was shocked when my concerns were discredited and that it took an email to the top for my needs to be properly addressed.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Realize there is a clear divide in this office and work to ensure every employee is appreciated. This office is rather two-faced and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It feels like the junior staff is in need of some love and may be the reason for the huge gap in the office. Please get a new manger for the intern program. Please. It is embarrassing -- Edelman does have a great program in place...why does she hinder it? Also, a job description would have eliminated a lot of issues I witnessed/was a part of.</advice-to-management>

“Could use some work”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a large company that seemingly exposes several career opportunities for employees. The catch is identifying where these opportunities lie strategizing how to tap into them. Edelman is a big name and a huge player in the PR field. Strategy-wise, the company seems to be headed in the right direction.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Work-Life balance: This does not seem to exist. Part of the reason that I joined the company was because of previous awards it had won in this arena. This may have changed since I arrived, or perhaps the balance is just not in my department, but consistantly takeing work home and working on the weekends is an expectation. I have also only taken a lunch a handful of times since employment.Training: I think the company could do more to ensure that newer employees were adequately trained in both the company tools and processes, but on the clients background. I cannot speak for all accounts, but for my practice I was given materials to review and then handed work, with no formal time to discuss best practices or history.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – My advice to upper management would be to have mid-managment take six sigma courses, or another type of efficiency course. From my perspective, there is no work-life balance because the work and review process simply are not being conducted in the best way possible. Often, an assignement will be given without being thought through and with little direction. The work will get completed, and have to be re-drafted several times. This causes delays to the clients and delays in activation, as well as a waste of time and money. Efficiency is key.I'd also recommend when training mid-management the company focus on starting meetings with positive aspects. There is much to be said to highlighting employees for good work done, and not drooning in negative news.</advice-to-management>

“A great company that tried to create, but too much hierarchy limits that.”

</title><pros>Pros – Lots of top clients across various industries, strong reputation and solid leadership at the top of the firm.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Way too much hierarchy in the office which limits the entrepreneurship the company likes to identify itself with; long hours for fairly meager pay and expected to always remain on the clock for clients even in less than pressing situations.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Reduce the number of positions within the firm - you don't need three levels at each stage, e.g. AE, SAE, SA and SAS. It creates bottlenecks and gives people too much ego in reviewing/proofing other people's work because they are "ranked" higher. Definitely think about increasing pay if you want to compare yourself to consulting companies where pay is astronomically higher.</advice-to-management>

“Looks good from the outside, dysfunctional from the inside”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has a good brand reputation, which means any time worked at the agency will look good on your resume. If you are starting out in your career, this is a good place to get experience in PR and to learn some best practices that will serve you well in the years to come.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I joined Edelman because of the agency's reputation, but was surprised at how mismanaged the company was when I started working there. Managers are trained to be very hard on their team, often pushing people to their limits in the interest of client service. Employees are often brought to tears either from the stress, workload, or critical feedback from managers. I've seen more coworkers crying in the ladies room than I care to count. Although you can learn a lot from working at this agency, the harsh culture and cutthroat nature of the company means you need very thick skin to survive here very long.</cons>

“Work”

</title><pros>Pros – I firmly believe there is no better place to grow your PR career than at Edelman. Having worked my way up from the intern level, I have received a wealth of opportunities, from client engagement to management opportunities to material development and strategic thinking, that I just don't think I would have had elsewhere. Talent and potential is both noticed and rewarded, and age does not factor into your success. Working hard doesn't just earn the respect of your co-workers, it can also translate into tangible, meaningful opportunities and benefits, including promotions and salary increases that could not be matched by any other agency in the city given my age or years of experience. Our office culture is also highly valued, and I appreciate the generous vacation time, flexible working hours in instances of appointments/emergencies and the constant encouragement to be ourselves and bring our best selves to the table.</pros>
<cons>Cons – More attention is paid to the thoughts of mid-level and senior leadership than to junior staff, which can sometimes make it seem like your word doesn't have as big of an impact. Work/life balance is harder to maintain as you increase seniority, particularly at the mid-level and lower-leadership spectrums. Additionally, there can be a lot of pressure to exceed expectations with clients, even those that are challenging or arguably refusing accurate, well-thought counsel. Especially in these instances where a collaborative relationship with a client is strained, team morale can suffer, and leadership can be slow to recognize the need for internal team change.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Acknowledge junior staff--we see and hear all within this office, and we work harder than many. Continue to acknowledge and reward good ideas and hard work--for me, this is what would make it hard to ever leave this agency.</advice-to-management>

“Love working at Edelman!”

</title><pros>Pros – I love working at Edelman. Despite what I had heard about traditional PR firms (particularly those the size of Edelman), the company has a collaborative work culture. You are encouraged to ask for what you want and voice your opinion, no matter what level you are. Perks also include insanely smart colleagues, transparent business practices and the fact that it is privately owned.</pros>
<cons>Cons – For the amount of work expected of the junior staff, starting salaries are very low. Work life balance isn't the best, but I have met people from PR firms with much worse balance. I think it's really a hallmark of the job (and the high-profile clients that come along with it) and less a reflection of the company.</cons>

“Everything is perfect -- except salary could be better”

</title><pros>Pros – Leadership, values and clients -- we are given an opportunity every single day to partake in some of the most exciting work going on in America and all over the world and when you factor in the greatness of what goes on inside the office -- the internal relationships we're building with our leaders and with each other -- Edelman is absolutely the best place to work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Salary for lower level employees -- it's not terrible but it's not exactly that attractive, especially when compared to that received by the same level employees at other businesses and in other industries.</cons>

“Steer clear of healthcare team in Atlanta!”

</title><pros>Pros – Opportunities to learn if you're on the right team and have a supportive manager.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman as a whole might be an okay place to work, as long as you're not a member of the healthcare team in Atlanta. The management of this team is manipulative and toxic and forced five people - including myself - to quit last year. Wish I had known going in that the healthcare team in Atlanta is known by the rest of the office as a horrible place to work. One Edelman Atlanta staffer on another team confessed she held her breath when she walked by our desks because the whole area gives off a toxic vibe and a well-liked and respected Atlanta EVP admitted he/she (trying to protect their anonymity) couldn't stand the SVP of the healthcare team and thought he was a poor excuse for a manager.</cons>

“Working at Edelman is rewarding and challenging (in a good way).”

</title><pros>Pros – I value Edelman's independence as an agency, its diverse practices and its global footprint.  The LA office is very diverse and offers a great location for commuting from most locations in SoCal. I believe there is good opportunity for professional growth within the LA office.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Because of its size, it does take time to navigate within the agency.  Edelman offers so many practice groups and services that it requires time to fully understand how to integrate them in your day to day operations.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Developing new business is important, but we must continue to keep our eyes on our current clients at all times. Sometimes your best new business is your existing clients.</advice-to-management>

“Progressive and Full of Opportunity”

</title><pros>Pros – The Edelman team, from Richard himself to each Assistant Account Executive, are simply the smartest group of professionals I've worked with in this industry. Having worked at two other large agencies, I can confidently say the level of talent at Edelman blows other agencies away. Senior management is incredibly involved and accessible and although it's a huge company, it somehow maintains a small, start-up feel. I think that's because they strongly encourage an agency-wide "entrepreneurial spirit," which empowers teams to pursue boundary-pushing programs for clients and employees to pursue limitless opportunities in their career path.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you don't have a strong POV, presence or outgoing personality, it's easy to get swallowed up at Edelman. Although it feels smaller, it's a huge, global agency at the end of the day and it truly gives life to the phrase "jump in the deep end and sink or swim."</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – We work on the road and from home pretty regularly and the rental laptop/remote access situation is pretty bad. Other than that, two thumbs up!</advice-to-management>

“Challenging, supportive”

</title><pros>Pros – It's the pre-eminent thought leader in its industry. It is an innovative, flexible and generous agency. Its relatively flattened hierarchy promotes communication and creativity from all levels.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I'm seriously having trouble coming up with something general and accurate. I mean, it's an intense job -- it's bound to take up considerable hours of the day, to involve periods of intense effort that do not result in a fruitful outcome, to butting heads with forceful, opinionated colleagues, etc. That would be the same at any company where growth and passion are integral components.</cons>

“Endless Opportunities”

</title><pros>Pros – The abundance of career opportunities here at Edelman is endless. The company is structured for each employee to ultimately determine their own career path based upon their interests. Additionally, as the top pr firm in the world Edelman attracts top tier talent and works with some of the largest brands in the world. Being with such a large company also allows you a global network of resources to assist you in your day-to-day needs and the opportunity to work with other Edelman offices across the world.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Part of this is just the nature of the industry, but it is very challenging to maintain a work/life balance at times. If you are only open to a 9-5 Monday-Friday gig, this industry and company is probably not the best fit for you. That said, Edelman is great about holidays and PTOs.</cons>

“Smart people, receptive senior management and limitless opportunities, but the experience is what you make of it.”

</title><pros>Pros – Amazing talent across the network (and knowledge sharing has become a much higher priority in recent months.) Edelman knows good people when they see them and do their best to retain them, whether it's through extended sick leave when a family is ill or footing the bill for an expensive conference. On the west coast (potentially elsewhere), they put a big emphasis on ongoing education, as well as getting to know/like your colleagues on a personal level, with bi-annual retreats. Depending on your team and manager, there is a LOT of room for professional growth and junior level team members are often given an unusual amount of responsibility based on good performance.In order to succeed at Edelman, you have to ask for what you want. As long as you make a case for your desires (especially concerning career path) and speak up early and often, you're generally rewarded.</pros>
<cons>Cons – At times, very long hours. Work/life balance isn't necessarily a myth, but it can be difficult. The salary also seems to be lower than industry standard.Your experience greatly depends on your team and manager. If you don't secure advocates for yourself and learn how to navigate the process/politics, it's very possible that you'll get overlooked for promotions, raises, etc.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more proactive with comp days, spot bonuses, and general recognition for a job well done. We love our jobs and don't mind working hard to deliver spectacular client service, but a more consistent reward system (or even a simple 'thank you' email) would go a long way in increasing overall job satisfaction.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a great place to come in and learn/improve your valuable PR skills based on insights from some of the best PR pros in the business. While Edelman is a big, privately owned company, you are never lost in the shuffle. There are numerous opportunities for additional education and spearheading new initiatives. If you have an idea, Edelman lets you run with it.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Typical agency problems - long hours, last minute deadlines, quick burn out ratio. The difference is that Edelman goes the extra mile to compensate you for your hard work with comp days, internal and external praise, etc.</cons>

“I learn something new every day!”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a great place to work - I'm surrounded by smart people who love a challenge and who are always willing to go the extra mile for our clients and each other. I learn something from my colleagues every day, and the firm appreciates and values ideas and work no matter where or who it comes from - intern or top creative director.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman is fast-paced environment focused on flawless execution and client service. People that thrive here have an innate entrepreneurial spirit and a thirst to always learn and change. You can't phone it in - you'll get run over by the next guy who wants it more than you.</cons>

The company has shifted directions and clearly communicates these changes to the entire organization, there is continued training and most importantly trust in each employee to take risks and be bold.</pros>
<cons>Cons – This industry is notorious for being one of the most stressful in the world, Edelman is no exception but that is not the fault of the company... more the choice of career.</cons>

“Challenging, Rewarding, Constantly-Evolving”

</title><pros>Pros – When they say it's an entrepreneurial environment...they mean it. It's a major company, but still scrappy like a start-up in many respects. The people, and the camaraderie among them, can't be beat.  And the company treats their employees well and truly has a "family" feel to it...it's the rare sort of place where people still can, and want to, build long-term careers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Internal structure lacks clarity and seems to be constantly changing. The ability to be flexible and adaptable is commendable, but at some point, there has to be some consistency and commitment to a path.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – 1) Give a long, hard look at fiscal structure throughout the organization. In an ideal world, we would adopt a set-up that ensures clients always get the best service, and thus continue to give us their business year after year.

“Great company, great people”

</title><pros>Pros – This office prides itself on high-quality work - and rightly so. Together, in an albeit high-pressure but collaborative atmosphere, this team delivers great work time and time again, consistently meeting client needs and exceeding expectations. I feel very supported in my work at Edelman; when I have run into difficulties with an account there are always many people willing to help out, offer encouragement or brainstorm solutions. I appreciate the company's global presence, as this allows for us to share resources and expertise cross-practice and cross-office to seamlessly meet client needs.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is a very large drinking culture here. I would encourage Edelman to examine this as part of the office culture. While it is fun to let loose, not everyone drinks heavily - and some don't drink at all believe it or not - and it's important to be inclusive of others and remember that there are healthier ways to de-stress. While this is admittedly an industry thing and not just an Edelman thing, Edelman strongly encourages drinking as the primary way to deal with stress and celebrate client wins, and upper management sets this example by their own behavior at office functions. While fun sometimes, this is not a sustainable stress reliever in the long run, and not always a healthy example to set for junior staff.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman network of PR practitioners in various verticals/specialties; client list / work; benefits; workplace environment; senior leadership; industry thought leadership; strong (and growing) Digital practice area</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's an agency - so you're going to put in the work and hours, but if you do, you will learn and grow your career quickly; some offices can be too "top-heavy" with not enough junior staff.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Continue to educate your employees - especially in satellite offices - with classes and further PR education with a variety of industry topics and trends. Continue to empower employees to explore other internal opportunities - domestic or abroad.

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has many opportunities for growth and career change for those that prove themselves and raise their hands. Edelman also cares deeply about making the company a fun, exciting and creative place to work, all while providing the benefits, policies and programs needed to feel supported. Creativity, autonomy and flexibility are always at our fingertips. What's not to love?</pros>
<cons>Cons – More dedication to improving compensation for top performers is needed. Rewards and recognition programs are good, but an added focus on rewards (including financial) for employees below VP would be appreciated by many.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep listening to employees through employee surveys and manager conversations with staff. Act on the things that matter most to employees.

“Smart people doing great work for clients.”

</title><pros>Pros – There are many pros to working for Edelman:  There's a commitment to IP that sets the firm apart from competitors and makes us all smarter; a privately-held firm, Edelman boasts strong leadership, from the very top and through the offices and practice areas; THere is culture of promoting from within and a focus on career planning; finally, global = opportunities for clients and staff alike.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Since it's big, Edelman can also be daunting to navigate internally.  With so many "A" personalities and over-achievers, there is also internal competitiveness that can get in the way -- to its credit, Edelman leadership keeps a keen eye on not letting it get out of hand!  As with other major PR firms, stress is commensurate size, major clients and focus on excellence.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – One piece of advice would be to balance the flow of internal initiatives.  There are so many new ideas, processes and initiatives, that it can be hard to keep up, learn new tricks and incorporate them into smart counsel to clients before another one (just as cool) comes along.</advice-to-management>

“Autonomy & Appreciation got married and had a kid - Productivity”

</title><pros>Pros – Best reasons to work here include:Very intelligent and pro-active management that tends to have come to work for the company for the right reasons. None of the grand-fathering into management positions seen here, which is rare.Excellent trust levels to get your work done, but accountability is always in place, so you can put your brilliant strategies to work on big name clients, but if that other guy's lousy idea fails you won't be blamed for it, he will.Knowledge sharing is encouraged and highly valued. I was surprised particularly in the world of PR that there was no miserly hoarding of intel or secretive action going on within account teams. Again, that knowledge sharing. Good stuff.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you're used to the high agency life, it's a little less lavish here. Not so many freebies, great clients but few outings and the work culture is professional in every way including social conduct.Don't go here for a bro-down, and they drink at 3pm on Fridays but don't expect anyone to hang around  the office after the bell rings.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The management here is really good at being supportive and suggestive, but not overpowering, and they keep their own workplates loaded up so things stay fair (I'm not a manager either, I feel like I need to mention that after this glowing review)</advice-to-management>

High turnover seems to be a detracting factor to team morale, the more people that leave the worse it gets for the incumbents.  HR could also do a better job in finding the right talent, their lassez faire attitude and lack of attention to detail makes it hard to build a strong team.</advice-to-management>

“Strike a better balance”

</title><pros>Pros – People, process, products, places. We have smart people; sound, documented approaches; innovative offerings; and offices in 67 cities throughout the world. There's a lot of opportunity with Edelman.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Little overhead. It's probably why we are so profitable, but it weighs heavy on PR staff.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Strike a better balance of billable/non-billable work for senior PR staff. In other words, senior people are expected to do a lot of administrative work (staffing, resource allocation, new business, budgeting, financial management, training, other non-billable initiatives, etc.) and not sacrifice client work to get it done. It is incredibly difficult as there are only 24 hours in a day. And most aren't motivated by all the administrative work, but rather would like to spend more time focusing on clients.</advice-to-management>

“Don't believe the hype”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman's extensive client list provides employees with the opportunity to work with some of the biggest brands in digital/consumer/health/travel.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman is by far the worst corporate culture I have ever experienced in my 10+ years on the job market.Account teams are ridiculously unorganized and upper management is populated with opportunistic and disingenuous individuals that play favorites and are all too eager to throw junior staff under the bus at a moment's notice.Rude emails, name calling, unjustified accusations of inefficiency, screaming obscenities on company conference calls: all part of the day-to-day life at Edelman.And if you think the Human Resources department will be there to help you when you inevitably bear the brunt of this abuse, think again! Edelman's HR department is by far the worst I have ever encountered.There are plenty of PR companies out there. Learn from my mistake and think twice before signing on the dotted line with these folks.</cons>

“Edelman will not appreciate you. You are expendable.”

</title><pros>Pros – The opportunity to work on large, very well-known brands and build a resume that will make you stand out, internal resources, learning opportunities</pros>
<cons>Cons – The culture has changed for the worse, the company has become too large and top-heavy, so mid-level staff are not properly supported and do the work of junior staff on top of their workload, very political- good work is not appreciated as much as it should be if you aren't "playing the game."</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – More junior staff support- your Senior Account Executives can't do everything. There is a lack of culture here- work is no longer fun. We spend 10-12 hours here a day and it feels like there is no point to being here and we are expendable. Appreciate the staff you have- give bonuses, Inspire us- don't just offer money to us if we get new hires- that is not how you retain talented staff. Appreciate those of us with media relations talent- that is the backbone of this business and you don't value it at all. Consulting is not everything. Be flexible with those who don't fit your account manager mode. There are many creative, talented people going to waste and leaving because you lack appreciation for those with amazing, non-cookie-cutter skills and expertise. I have been here for seven years and never expected to feel this way.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Great for your resume.High profile clients being great experience.Lots of in-house perks, i.e. office parties, outside events, catering, massages, etc.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not easy to transition to new position OR new office.Upper management doesn't make time to engage and teach level 1 and 2 employees.NO sense of team work. Most people are just trying to get ahead for themselves.High level employees express no plan to fix continuous problems regarding morale in the office.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Walk around the office and talk to people.Engage with lower level employees....you're upset cause they're not doing their job, and they're frustrated cause they have NO IDEA how their daily tasks are contributing to the bigger picture!!!BE PRESENT in the office and at office events! They know you're busy, but would it hurt to try?Take a look at the workload your teams have...and the time they have to do it.

“Fast-paced, always changing environment with great people but occasionally questionable decision-making”

</title><pros>Pros – The people are amazing. You'll make great friends and feel invited into a very collaborative, friendly environment by your peers. The agency at large is very well-respected, which is a great status to maintain and be part of when working with clients.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Decisions made by senior leadership are not communicated well to employees. Any communications that are made by leadership are clouded in positivity, lacking detail and decreasing their credibility. Also, the leadership team seems to have become a group in and of themselves, protecting one another and becoming more disconnected from the team at large. For example, senior leadership members  were almost all promoted to higher positions during the most recent common review season, while hard-working and deserving midlevel staff were largely overlooked despite similar years of experience and age.</cons>

“Great work experience, but lots of double standards and too much office politics”

</title><pros>Pros – You really get to learn a lot at Edelman! Anyone new to the business will get all the training they need starting their career here.  If you can get someone from upper management "behind" you, you will excel and do really well. The first three years there, I experienced relative job growth and comparable salary adjustments.  There were a lot of employee perks and benefits- probably the most I've ever had at any other company.  If you like hard work, are just starting out and need experience, this is the place for you!  I thoroughly enjoyed my job here and all that I was able to take away from the experience.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There was a great salary disparity at all levels- raises were based on who you know, who your team managers are, and what clients you worked for.  Once the VIP behind me was let go through "downsizing," there was no more job growth or salary adjustments.  I noticed a glass ceiling for minority job growth and advancement- no minority upper level managers, and virtually no minority staff (other than interns) working on projects that were "diversity" oriented! Managers were reluctant to let their good employees advance to other areas of the company.  Often, new people or temporary consultants were hired on instead of promoting from within across areas.  Seniority didn't really mean much unless you were an Executive level employee.  There was a lot of back-stabbing and corporate bickering among staff, double standards for different staff levels and even finger-pointing, blaming and all-around very hostile environment. The micro-managing became unbearable- I had to clock in/out when I used the restroom??  HR was not very helpful-  seemingly mediators, but never resolved any issues other than to assist with your exit interview, which by the time you were done with it, your computer was disconnected from the system and you were locked out of any files and your access denied!  Communication is the cornerstone of Public Relations- how ironic that Edelman can execute PR events with the best of them, but management had some of the poorest communicators I had ever worked with!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get a clue!  Undercover Boss is a great show that opens the eyes of out-of-touch bosses- Edelman needs a serious dose of that!  My experience was a few years ago, but if things haven't changed much (which from reading other reviews I gather they haven't), try being more open-minded and not so narrowly focused on traditional ways of running a business.  Try equality across the board, not by department or levels of management.  You need to think outside the box with regards to organizational behavior relative to management and staff, and be just as creative as you are with your PR events. Hire more diverse staff:  people who can bring new cultures, ideas and ways of doing things to senior level positions, and not just in their own countries! Hire a company like Accenture to help make Edelman the type of company people expect it to be!</advice-to-management>

“Best Public Relations Internship Out There”

</title><pros>Pros – At Edelman, interns work incredibly hard and are given a lot of responsibility. Most interns handle a workload of a AAE and add a tremendous amount to their portfolio. You're going to work more than 9-5 but that's standard PR for you! I've found that upper management is really receptive to hearing ideas from all members of the team, including interns, and it was pretty cool being able to contribute to overall strategy as an intern.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is pretty meager and I think that creates stress for interns, especially when you're there for six months.</cons>

“Wonderful but challenging career”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is world-class. They cultivate the best strategic minds in the industry - they train professionals to not just be mouth pieces, but true partners and counsel to clients. There is a wonderful range of clients to work on and many growth opportunities, as long as you put in the work and dedication. The people are fantastic - some the brightest - but also fun and wonderful to be around. The leadership really cares about its people. They provided awesome programs to aid in professional and personal development.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Work-life balance was always a challenge, especially if you had demanding clients but I think that's true of any large agency. It can be easy to burn out if you don't set smart boundaries. There was also office politics (minimal) but again I think that's true of any agency. Edelman seems to be on the lower-end of the scale when it comes to compensation.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Sometimes it didn't seem that negative feedback in peer reviews of management was taken seriously. Poor managers would still be promoted because they kept clients happy. It might help if there was follow-up or acknowledgement that those managers wore working to improve their management skills.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – - Great HR staff, willing to speak with you and help you at anytime when they aren't busy- Great amount of projects on the consumer marketing side (However, you must have the staff trust you with the projects or they will give them to a paid intern; your experience is really what you make of it)- Good perks throughout the week (food, etc)- A lot of opportunity to attend client meetings; if you are invited</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Senior management can be very wishy washy with their expectations of you; depending on the work load or their mood. This can disrupt communication effectiveness.- Arguably, Interview expectations can be completely different from the expectation when you start your traineeship</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – - Senior management should have more respect for their trainees presence. Edelman is a lot of work, requires a tremendous amount of time, and can be very stressful for people whom are in school.- Overall Edelman is the number one PR Firm for a reason.

“Good learning environment, but management is a disappointment”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a good place to start your career. You work long hours and are presented with very challenging tasks, but you can learn a lot over a short period of time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As you continue working for Edelman over a period of time, you learn that those who get promoted are basically failing up. The ones who succeed are not the best PR specialists, but those who are best at PR'ing themselves.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management should reflect more carefully on why Edelman loses many of its best people after working there for only a couple of years. People become disillusioned. They don't leave for salary reasons. It is because they are not being rewarded in other ways.</advice-to-management>

“Good training ground for junior and mid level”

</title><pros>Pros – Young professionals get exposure to PR at top notch client companies, along with many lesser known companies.  Opportunities exist to work o a wide variety of client types and industries.Benefits and compensation are good to very good, opportunity for travel and there's even global "work abroad for a year" program.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Easy to get siloed in a group or on a large account, but Edelman has improved opportunities for employees to transfer teams and onto new accounts over the last few years.Lots of egos and internal competition among offies, practice areas and individuals.  Squeaky wheels tend to get a lot of grease, deserved or not.  Lots of big egos.  Still a pink collar ghetto, with the vast majority of upper management jobs held by men, though arguably slowly improving in this area.Expectation that you are "always on, always connected" can be burnout.  Definitely not a 9-5 place.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Bad behavior at senior levels tolerated too often and too long, although efforts have been taken to address this in the past few years; base pay is typically fair at senior levels although bonus potential is relatively low (and target payouts just decreased by 1 percent in FY13, although stretch potential increased accordingly)</cons>

“Great work environment, but only limited support resources for people below the VP level”

</title><pros>Pros – 1. I feel secure in my job.2. It is easy to find a mentor within the firm. We have a formal mentorship program, but even without enrolling, it is easy to find industry leaders willing to provide professional and career advice. This has been invaluable for me.3. My current team dynamic is awesome. I enjoy working with the people on my local team, and we work together to produce outstanding results for our clients.</pros>
<cons>Cons – 1. I have not been provided the technology resources (laptop, compatibility with Mac products, etc.) that are necessary to support high levels of dedication to my clients' accounts. Though our IT department has been updating systems, there seems to be a reluctance to provide those expected to execute the2. Staffing seems to be heavily weighted toward the senior management side of the business. The ratio of strategists to executors on accounts often seems to be 1:1, where it should be more weighted toward execution.3. Though my colleagues and I are often asked for opinions on how to conduct client activities, it often seems these are courtesies rather than legitimate requests for input.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get real with technology - the folks doing the work for clients run Macs now. IT always complains that Macs aren't secure, but they've made it work for our creative staff in Digital, so it must be possible. Make remote desktop compatible with Macs, or give us laptops like most other professional service firms.</advice-to-management>

“A Stand-out Employer Among the Other PR Agencies”

</title><pros>Pros – -Training is much more robust and taken more seriously than at any other agency-Work-life balance (it is what you make it - I've found mine and so have several of my other colleagues)-Many or most teams work cross-practice-Everyone knows Edelman... if you've worked here for any length of time, people seem to take you a bit more seriously as a PR professional-LEADERSHIP - we have exceptional leadership in our office; he's very accessible and focused on making things better for his teams-Edelman NEXT - allows you to carve your own path and how you want to progress within the agency, even if you want to change directions or locations-Working at Edelman Atlanta comes with all the benefits of being at a world-class (arguably the best) PR agency - smart people, our colleagues set precedents and trends all the time and our clients are some that people dream for years of working with-Pretty lax "business casual" dress code, yet we can wear jeans every day</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Office location and surroundings downtown-Parking (we pay if we're below VP and the deck is NOT very safe)-Non-competitive salary (even after it's been increased, it's still below several other agencies - big and small)-Comp time policy for working outside of workday schedule (but to be fair, that's an agency-wide issue)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please, please, please be a little more prudent with who is put into leadership positions, especially those with records of high turnover and employee management issues. And I'd also advise to continue tying to improve compensation for employees - especially in comparison to agencies in town like Porter, MSL, C&W, etc.</advice-to-management>

“Great Company to Work For”

</title><pros>Pros – You can create your own path at Edelman if you a. meet the right people b. work hard in showcasing your talents to senior leadershipPeople- Brilliant, talented, friendly. There's always the difficult person here and there but overall, everyone is just incredibly nice and smart. i don't leave mainly because of the people actually..</pros>
<cons>Cons – FavoritismCompensation: Unfortunately, the longer you stay, you realize that others competitors are paying more outside and people that come in are making more than you. It's very disappointing.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Pay attention to training your junior staff.

“A place where you can truly grow your career”

</title><pros>Pros – 1. Enterpreneurial spirit is one of the company's values - they encourage you to take risks and challenge yourself.  If something doesn't work, dust yourself off and try again.  That's why so much great work is done here.2. Opportunities for career pathing - Edelman has a "matrix" organization. You don't move straight up the ladder, you can move laterally, vertically, etc.  If you want to try something new, there is a geography track, practice track, GCRM (global client) track to look forward to.  If you don't feel like you are fitting into your current role, seek something new or propose creating a new role if possible.3. Good work-life balance. We work very hard but Edelman is a family-run business and they understand the importance of needing to blow off steam and family time.  Employees are given great options for paid time off and the company holds fun events like happy hours to build camarderie in the office.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The fast pace may not be for everyone.  You need to be flexible and able to focus on many things at once, lest you be left behind.</cons>

“Everyday I learn something new - the work is engaging and there are constant opportunities to   grow!”

</title><pros>Pros – Work hard, play hard - If you continue to do good work, Edelman makes sure to reward you for your efforts. The company is very transparent and clearly demonstrate that they care, value, and appreciate their employees. Edelman tends to treat everyone with respect, including the interns. There is no closed door policy because there are no offices, it's a very open environment and people are approachable. Edelman cares about employee growth and work/life balance.  There are many company paid outings to gather with your fellow colleagues and let loose a bit. I love that I can wear comfortable clothing to the office everyday! This is not always common in an office setting. Richard Edelman seems to be a very humble, and genuinely nice man.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Like any agency, at times you are spread to thing or have overwhelming amounts of work. However, Edelman does attempt to try to create a balance as much as possible.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – In my experience, very little hand holding and micromanagement.  There is at times red tape which could be scaled back a bit. The trust is there because Edelman professionals are among the best in the business, but at times there is sensitivities about how to approach media or clients etc. The more trust you instill in your fellow colleagues or subordinates, the more they will have the opportunity to grow, learn and get comfortable interacting with different constituents.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Politics don't play such a high role here. You're legitimately rewarded for your efforts. There's also no discrimination or egos flying around when it comes to sharing great ideas and going with the best one. Everyone is freakishly smart but incredibly funny and down to earth. You feel like you can be yourself here.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I know I can easily ask for a higher salary elsewhere but to be working with this team is truly a privilege. Good people are hard to find...especially in New York.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – In many instances there are individuals given a SVP or EVP title who granted have many talents but sometimes they lack in the actual skill of managing people.

“I've had better.”

</title><pros>Pros – Large company names look great on resumes. Once you get your foot in the door you can transfer to other offices/cities. If you get the rare chance to work with other offices (new york/chicago/atlanta), you can learn a lot. Severance packages tend to be generous (or so we've heard).</pros>
<cons>Cons – Culture is driven by fear. Local management has zero agency management experience. Turnover of respected and talented employees is extremely high. Agency brand recognition is low in the market. All the free coffee and soda (or meal replacement shakes....) in the world can't make up for a hostile work environment.</cons>

“PR staff: excellent. MIS operations: needs work.”

</title><pros>Pros – In my 15-month tenure at Edelman, I have met some amazing people in the PR business and, as an MIS team member, been involved with some large and interesting projects. Senior leadership of the company seems to have a vision and a plan to execute it, and is doing it very well. Benefits are good, and time-off policies (vacation, sick, leave, etc) are great.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Unfortunately, the vision for the global MIS infrastructure is not only clouded, but nearly non-existent... or at least, not communicated to staff. The global infrastructure team has cycled through five managers in eight months and continues to be understaffed. The CIO position has been vacant for at least six months. The US-wide bonus eligibility was changed suddenly this year to require over 12 months of service (and not pro-rated), excluding several people hired 12-13 months earlier who were counting on it... it does make me feel less valued than the person sitting next to me who has been employed three weeks longer than me. Salaried MIS team members really feel that, being a cost center and not billable, we are not given the consideration that billiable employees may sometimes get. During a recent office seating re-organization, the entire NY-based MIS team was moved from the open-cubicle seating plan to what amounts to glorified picnic tables.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There are some great people in MIS... long-term employees, smart and accomplished... that would make great leaders. Each infrastructure team leader on the revolving door was hired externally. Management should look to promote from within, as they do in the PR practices (this is why I have rated "Career Opportunities" very low.) And, at the very minimum, the MIS department needs a global CIO to provide an overall vision and execution plan. Lastly, uncouple the purchasing of MIS equipment from the regional CIOs and put it under one unified, global team. It is very difficult for the global infrastructure team, charged with providing efficient connectivity worldwide, to provide such a service when a local person can easily say "no, we don't want to spend the money" and then complain about their sub-par access to resources.</advice-to-management>

It is clear your experience here is what you make of it. This and the work/life balance will (hopefully) have me calling Edelman home for years to come.</pros>

“If you work in PR, you want to work here.”

</title><pros>Pros – -Training and development: Edelman U, mentoring from direct supervisor, and opportunities to learn management skills at a junior level were invaluable as a young professional. Also received feedback regularly (good or bad) from supervisors which helped me improve and learn consistently.-Opportunities to work with top brands and on global accounts: Several accounts I worked on were based in major US and International markets outside of New York, which gave the opportunity to gain experience working in markets other than where I live.-Perks and benefits: Amazing benefits and perks available from day one. Felt that Edelman truly created a benefits package that was about the total person not just the professional.-Employee engagement: Excellent programs to get involved with co-workers and communities outside the office.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Work/life balance: provided little flexibility/mobility with the option to work from home. Often had to work on time off and on family vacations. Extremely hard to completely disconnect for even a day.Review process seemed trivial as I learned that promotion decisions were made before the 360 reviews were complete. It seemed to be more political than based on merit or meeting goals that were set for the year (can be true for a lot of companies, but still disheartening).</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Forward-thinking company that is a step (or more) ahead of everyone else when it comes to anticipating the future, due largely to senior leadershipOpportunities for career growthEmployee satisfaction is a major priority</pros>
<cons>Cons – Within specific practices/offices, senior team members can be lazy (work from home or come in late and/or leave early) while junior team members do a disproportionate amount of the heavy liftingWhen turnover occurs, replacement hires are rarely adequate compared to former employees - it seems as if some hires have been made primarily so that current employees can collect a referral bonusNo matter how often it is preached, office politics (between other practices or offices, or even within the same team) is a frequent issue</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Ensure that everybody, not just junior team members, does their fair shareWhile replacement hires will by nature have different strengths and weaknesses than their predecessors, make sure they fill the voids the team needs them to fillCrack down on all aspects office politics by refusing to reward it and disciplining those who engage in it at the expense of others</advice-to-management>

“Tons of experience to be had, tons of work to be done”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman will give you, by far, one of the best professional experience in the business. They'll also work you as such. If you're up for the challenge, go for it. But do know that this is not a 9-5 job. There's also a big push for giving people opportunities if you, a) prove you're worth the investment and b) ask for it. Whether it's moving groups or offices, the longer you stay with the company, the more you'll get back.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very low pay compared to the amount of work you do. Also, your experience is very much tied to who your manager is. If your manager sticks up for you and acts as an advocate, you'll go far. If not, you may be overlooked -- simply because everyone is too busy to notice.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Pay your employees more. Especially with junior staff, one of the reasons they leave at such a high rate is because they feel underpaid.</advice-to-management>

“Smart People, Entrepreneurial Environment, Focus on Outstanding Strategic Thinking"”

</title><pros>Pros – Excellent opportunities to grow and learn at this huge "mom and pop" consultancy.  I love the intelligence, passion and commitment of the people I work with, and the challenging assignments keep me engaged.  Edelman's IP offering is a huge enhancement, helping all associates connect as part of a larger global conversation and offering something truly unique and valuable to clients and other stakeholders.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's a very, very political place.  The path to promotion is unclear and byzantine.  And senior management is sometimes slow to correct or remove under-performing group heads and other leaders. It doesn't necessarily impact work on a day-to-day basis, but this swirl can begin to feel frustrating, and become a significant time suck.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Pay very close attention to your practice group heads - especially in the shadow P&Ls.  They need to be effective managers AND visionary leaders offering a clear strategic direction and plan to get there.  This seems lacking at the moment, though there is some signs of movement in the right direction.</advice-to-management>

“Best place to build a career in PR”

</title><pros>Pros – Hands down the best place to build a career in PR; ability to work on major global brands; access to the best proprietary resources and research; relatively competitive salaries and benefits; ability to work from and experience various offices within the network; culture is great in most offices</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman's a huge firm, so you can easily feel overwhelmed - there's a lot of PR you need to do for yourself to get noticed, but managers for the most part are your advocates; account teams are very large and you may only have one or two, so it's easy to paint yourself into a corner</cons>

“A community of brilliant individuals who genuinely like working with one another”

</title><pros>Pros – Like any workplace, Edelman Digital is all about the people. Luckily, the work force consists of some of the brightest and most driven people in the industry-- without any of the competitiveness or petty infighting of other agencies. With an open floor plan, horizontal account structure, and a cheerful, collaborative culture, it's a fun place to work where talent and hard work are recognized and rewarded. More attention is paid to creative thinking than job titles, and great work comes out of the tight-knit teams. The Digital crew may work hard, but they also play hard and have a lot of fun together both in and out of the office.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As with any agency, work/life balance can definitely get to be an issue-- but supervisors go out of their way to provide comp days, bonuses even at a junior level, and positive recognition when you're working long hours.</cons>

“A great place to start your PR career”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has an amazing training program and access to some of the best resources. Everyone who works at Edelman is very driven, intelligent and hungry with ambition. This is a great company to start your PR career. You will have the opportunity to work on some really top-tier clients. Edelman is also a great company to put on your resume as they are one of the top PR agencies in the world.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is a lot of politics and red tape at Edelman. Promotions and requests to change teams/offices (a benefit they push) can take a long time and requires a lot of work from the employee. You can often get lost in the shuffle. Employees that have been there for several years are often overlooked for promotions and pushed aside. Many people have had to threaten to leave to get the promotions they deserve. The pay is not good and the hours are very long.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't get so caught up in meeting corporate numbers, reviews, hours, etc. that you forget to reward the people who are working in the trenches. A small token of appreciation and recognition goes a long way!</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Imagine a work environment where you're recognized for your hard work and overtime, praised for taking initiative and speaking your mind, and encouraged to balance your life and work as best you can - that's Edelman. My management was excellent, co-workers were cool, and I learned more about business at Edelman than any of my previous positions. It was non-stop busy in my department, but the days flew by! If you're offered a position at this company, I highly recommend taking the job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The department and position I worked in was very busy and often felt under staffed. Some days I left with my head throbbing but, of course, most jobs are like that once in a while.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The management style at Edelman Chicago is great. It was obvious in my department that management communicated regularly and rarely let pressing staff issues fester. Well done!

</title><pros>Pros – A dynamic place to work; lots of smart and ambitions people; casual dress code; good benefits; flexibility to balance life and work; convenient office location</pros>
<cons>Cons – It can be very cliquey, certain managers play obvious favorites, etc. People make quick judgments here and if you don't fit in off the bat then it's nearly impossible to dig yourself out of that hole. The Chicago office's ability to retain diverse staff is appalling (and I define "diverse" very loosely to mean anyone with a background other than a white sorority girl or a gay man).</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please put some more thought into how to staff people on international assignments -- either short-term projects or even relocation.

“Rewarding”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a place that nurtures its employees.  Everyone is asked to come forward with their goals and managers are always open to helping employees acheive those goals.  It's also a place of opportunity. Staff members are challenged to take on exciting projects.  There's never a dull moment at Edelman.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman, while a place of opportunity and growth, can be a very busy environment.  There's always a lot to juggle and a lot to learn, for staff at every level.  But I also find that is what keeps Edelman employees engaged.  Managers also do a great job at helping staff find their own work/life balance.</cons>

“The best people and clients, but long hours”

</title><pros>Pros – A-list clients who are willing to think big and spend big (as much as anyone will in this economic environment). Really smart, hard-working people and a collegial environment where people help each other out and work as a team. You can find industry-leading experts in almost any aspect of PR here and tap their expertise. This is a great place to learn PR from a big-agency perspective - account management, client services and a wide range of PR strategies and tactics. Management appreciates how hard we work and allows for a lot of latitude in when, where and how people work. They are open and willing to let people switch groups and accounts in order to expand their skill set, in my experience.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The hours are long and the clients extremely demanding -- more than at the smaller agencies I've worked at. There is a certain amount of office politics at the senior levels and that can trickle down to the rest of the staff. Much of the media relations work is done by media specialists and on some accounts that means entry-level staff don't get much direct experience pitching reporters; candidates who are looking for media relations experience should ask specific questions about this when interviewing.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hire more people so we can work fewer hours. Flexibility, dress code, etc. are really appreciated but the workload is what burns people out. I am also regularly seeing a trend where people who shove work off to others are praised (and promoted) for effective delegation and modeling work-life balance, whereas those who get stuck with the work are criticized for not managing their time effectively.</advice-to-management>

“It would be hard to find a better PR agency to work for.”

</title><pros>Pros – The agency values innovation and is constantly introducing new tools for clients and employees to help ensure service delivered meets evolving communications needs.Senior professionals at Edelman are among the best in the industry.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman seems overly structured in the way it advances employees with a calendar approach to promotions and raises. A more fluid system of recognition might alleviate recurrant morale issues at review periods.</cons>

“Create your own adventure”

“Demanding but rewarding”

</title><pros>Pros – If you work hard, you are rewarded for it. Opportunities for growth are fairly provided and there is an environment that fosters the growth of those who go above and beyond. My managers are the best managers I have ever had in my professional life (though it is relatively short). They genuinely look out for my best interests and allow me to work autonomously. At the same time, they go out of their way to provide me with the help I need if I ask for it.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Can be incredibly demanding and high stress. In an effort to manage the economic downturn, they rely on existing employees before hiring new candidates. While this is a good thing in that it means there are no layoffs, it can translate into overworking employees (i.e. asking one person to play the role of three). They expect a lot from junior staff ... but if you prove yourself, you are usually rewarded for it.</cons>

“Some good, some not so good.”

</title><pros>Pros – Unparalleled intellectual property and industry insight, from Trust Barometer to Capital Staffers to other sector-specific research.Brainpower that is as strong as anywhere in the industry. Edelman people are smart and have good ideas.A fair number of passionate, good people who are colleagues as well as friends.Strong benefits package.Access to technology and resources like research and graphics/design.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Internal politics, both between and within offices, that lead to people being kept in the dark, trying to control staff/accounts to protect money, or talking negatively about colleagues (including to their supervisees). There are people known throughout the office for being mean or difficult, but they get promoted?Favoritism for certain groups and individuals in promotions and office recognition. it creates a negative vibe that causes cliques and harms the friendly nature of the place.No pushback on nightmare clients. Some clients are verbally abusive, issue unrealistic demands, or generally treat Edelman people horribly. Yet senior management don't push back on the abuse, always say "yes" instead of managing expectations, and expect staff to just deal with it by working harder and ignoring how they are treated. There's a reason there are accounts no one wants to work on.Decreased emphasis on core, fundamental skills like writing and media pitching, but lots of talk about buzzword-y "public engagement." As the company has pushed its strategic approach, there seem to be fewer junior and supervisor level employees interested in becoming excellent writers, understanding how media works, or learning all fundamentals of the industry.Limited opportunities for overseas exchanges or work transfers (management thinks they are resolving with International Fellows, which moves 8 people per year in a company of 3,500).</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Practice what we preach: Recommit to transparent and inclusive communication when it comes to promotions, multi-office work, and staffing. Stop letting people who create division or conflict to continue to serve as team leaders (and even be rewarded for their behavior) and invest in stronger management training. Double-down on leadership development for staff, so potential rising leaders have more opportunities. Better manage staffing so the same people aren't overworked all the time. Recapture some of the hard-working, modest personality that defined Edelman before it became the biggest.</advice-to-management>

“Every Experience is Unique to Your Team”

</title><pros>Pros – -Great classes from Edelman's experts. Really sharpen my media relations and writing skills.-Nice random perks. Free Starbucks and Chik-Fil-a on occasion. The office also planned random fun activities as a stress release.-Mostly everyone had really positive friendly attitudes. Never sensed in hostility.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There were days when I was up to my eyeballs in random "chores" while other interns were twidling their thumbs. My computer was incredible old and slow. I felt like pulling my hair when deadlines were speeding near. I basically worked on the same assignment everyday for hours. I was bored to tears (LITERALLY)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Maybe the internship should do a rotation of the different sectors within the office. I was so envious of the consumer and digital interns.</advice-to-management>

“Poor Management Accountability”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has an excellent reputation for the work they execute and the high caliber clients. They attract desirable accounts which provide great experience and depth for any PR professional looking to expand their background.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The biggest problem with Edelman I believe boils down to their size. They are the biggest privately owned firm in the world, which in turn can make it difficult to ensure employees are being treated fairly and given the opportunities needed to grow at all levels. I have heard other groups have great team unity and leadership, however within certain groups in the corporate practice the lack of senior management oversight leads to extreme misconduct amongst mid-level management. Verbal abuse and poor communication of expectations lead to loss of good talent. If they cannot retain the smart employees at the account level, they will continue to have problems cultivating their practice areas.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management needs more accountability amongst the SVP and VP level in treatment of employees. They tout themselves as team orientated, yet in my numerous years of experience within several agencies I have never seen such a lack of team spirit. Every person within my group at the account levels expressed no desire to stay with the group in the next two years. The groups high turnover rate through people leaving the company or moving practices is evidence of the lack of both professionalism and leadership.</advice-to-management>

“Great work-life balance, but less responsibility at lower levels compared to other firms”

</title><pros>Pros – Management is very supportive of work-life balance.  Client/project load is very reasonable.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Recruitment could be more selective - often times they look to fill the slot as fast as possible.  The account teams then pay a high price for team members who aren't a good fit.   Additionally the expectations and corresponding responsibilities given to more junior level employees are far below those at competitive firms.  Coming from another agency (making a lateral move) I felt like I'd gone back two years in time when I started at Edelman.</cons>

“Fairly new, but very happy”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has a reputation of attracting the "best of the best" to work in an environment that is fast-paced, challenging, forward-thinking and engaging. Guess what? The reality lives up to the reputation. I am consistently impressed with the intelligence, competence, forward-thinking management and ideas my colleagues come up with. Senior management is approachable and open to ideas from employees at all levels - a welcome change from some other agency environments - and nearly everyone has a thirst for "more:" learning, living, doing. If you want to learn, to be challenged and see some great things brought to life, Edelman is an ideal place to call home.</pros>
<cons>Cons – At 500-600 employees, Edelman is one of the larger agencies in Chicago. It spans four floors in the AON center and, truthfully, that kind of change can be a little daunting. That said, management recognizes this and is working to provide smaller group orientations and practice meetings to help orient new hires. Additionally, employees work hard and long hours. Vacation isn't frowned upon, but can be difficult to schedule and take.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I've found Edelman's senior management to be incredibly intelligent, engaging and approachable. They want to see their teams succeed and, thus, are willing to invest time in their employees (at all levels). I'm thrilled to be contributing to the resulting work and learning from these individuals.</advice-to-management>

“Great People Make All the Difference”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman DC is a great place to work because of the people who work there. The team comprises smart, hard working, ambitious (but not cut-throat competitive) people who are also fun, funny and kind. Taken collectively, they create a culture that rewards both professional excellence and personal investment. As with any job, the workload varies from challenging to dull and at times there is more work-life balance than others. But, when you are working with people who you truly believe are good people, who want the best for the client and for their team members, you want to put forth extra effort. I think our clients see this in our work too, which is why we have excelled in this market, particularly in recent years.</pros>
<cons>Cons – While generally, I feel the office is well-managed, there is not always transparency, particularly on compensation issues.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Continue to foster a culture of transparency – be more candid with employees about their performance relative to their peer set and how that impacts compensation. Continue to hold office-wide meetings and to leverage group heads to communicate with employees about strategic decisions and their impact on the office and employees. Also, I hope as the office continues to grow, you work to retain the personal feel and intimacy that makes it such a great place to work. I worry, even now, that we are losing that.</advice-to-management>

“A place that encourages”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman's many industry awards and significant growth over the last 5 years are well-deserved. The management team is constantly reevaluating the company's strategy and competitive position. The company rewards innovative thinking and permits employees to take risks and try new things.Edelman's size and prominence attracts top-tier clients and employees often have the opportunity to work on interesting projects that get attention.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Like all professional services firms, Edelman employees work fairly long hours and are expected to be available by PDA on nights and weekends.While we have big-name clients, there are plenty of projects that aren't particularly sexy. A single employee's experience will be largely shaped by his clients and team. It is possible to change divisions (e.g., Consumer, Technology, Corporate, etc.), but it doesn't happen often and the employee must go through an interview process much like an external candidate.Overall, Edelman offers rich opportunities, but an employee must actively pursue them.</cons>

“Great place to work, and a company that is continuously improving”

</title><pros>Pros – --The company continues to innovate and grow--Edelman focuses on the staff and on making sure this is a company where people can have long and meaningful careers--You get a chance to work on some of the biggest clients and best projects</pros>
<cons>Cons – As the company grows we continue to add capabilities in different divisions, which means multiple groups within Edelman can handle the same project (Ruth, MATTER, Consumer Marketing, etc). As a result you often find yourself competing against other Edelman teams or offices for chunks of a client's business.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Continue investing in the young employees. Pay them better, give them more training, give them more ways to grow and learn and experience.</advice-to-management>

“Edelman is a great place to work!”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a great place to work. Very talented people work here. Their are numerous opportunities for exposure within the company. Edelman recognizes people's strengths and places them in positions to exceed. People who work here are best in class and have a great attitude.</pros>
<cons>Cons – My only con about working here is that pay is not as great as comparable companies. They do standard one-year reviews and that is the only time, most often to receive a pay increase. Most people work way more than 40 hours a week and that is almost an expectation. Work/life balance is getting better and the company is doing a good job at voicing their support for time off and breaks as needed.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep up the great stuff at Edelman. My only recommendation is offering more competitive salaries and benefits packages. Premiums and deductibles are pretty high for insurance plans.</advice-to-management>

“Edelman”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is in its own category of excellence.   The work and clients are top-notch, the senior management is supportive of work/life balance, and an entrepreneurial spirit is woven into the company's DNA.  You can work at Edelman for a very long time, and completely reinvent yourself many time along the way.  There are hundreds of niche experts in all areas throughout the company - you never have to wing it with clients, you can find an expert to weigh in.  My co-workers are passionate about this company in a way that simply doesn't exist at publically held companies.  Our U.S. workforce of 2,000 is a force to behold - and we usually win at what we set out to accomplish.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Shrinking violets might take a bit longer to adjust to so many bold, confident co-workers.</cons>

“Edelman is everything they say they are and more”

</title><pros>Pros – When you read the bios and mission statements of companies often times what they desire to be is not what is in the mirror. This isn't so at Edelman. What you see is not what you get; it is quite more. It's refreshing to be in a place that is so transparent.</pros>

“When you first start at Edelman...”

</title><pros>Pros – Lots of energy, fun, exciting.  Variety of tasks and employee moral building is all around each and every week.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You have to be a self-starter and cheer for yourself initially.  What are the working hours?  Do you get overtime when you have to stay late or come in early to finish a task or project.  What is my job description?  What is my level?  None of this was explained until after the 4 week meeting with my supervisor.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I think there should be an initial meeting with other admins to help you learn the ropes, how to integrate yourself with the Edelman/Digital culture. Maybe there should be little "clubs" for each job type so you can start off strong.  Everyone is not a self-starter or proactive and therefore without some guidance they might become disillusioned early in their career at Edelman.  I took it as an adventure and journey to meet people and find and discover and learn the systems at Edelman.  Everyone might not like it that way.</advice-to-management>

“High expectations and demands without giving mentoring & professional development back”

</title><pros>Pros – Benefits are fair. Company well known in the field. Managers are totally available via phone, email, IM, BBM, etc. (not sure this is a pro).</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management focused on bringing in new business & protecting their practice's bottom line. Leads to not sharing knowledge & resources with other practices in the same office; and keeping team members fully&over utiliized even if it means over-servicing (anything to keep the client happy in a recession).Also, many times teams are top heavy with SVPs and there aren't enough junior staffers to do the bulk of the work. So junior staffers end up doing a lot of work well below their level. There is a serious lack of opportunities for jr. level staff  to take the lead or serve as point person on projects or accounts. And the lack of interns (except for the most profitable practices) means a lack of ways for jr. staff to develop supervisory skills.  Plus, with not enough hours in the day, there isn't really time for the senior staff to mentor.Very political environment where the deemed "up and comers" are favored heavily for advancement. (You hear the same names again and again.)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Advice to junior level staffers riding out the recession:Be your own advocate. If possible, be on a winning new business team (sure way to earn brownie points). Keep your resume updated & and your confidence up.</advice-to-management>

“Great Name, Poor Mid and Lower Level Management”

</title><pros>Pros – Looks great on resume. Provides amazing exposure to high profile clients (depending on assignment). If you play your cards right and are willing to put yourself out there, you can have access to some of the great thinkers in the PR industry today.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman is definately a powerhouse PR firm, but the things that make it so great don't always permeate down to the mid and lower level management, making it hard to really learn and grow within the internship. Your experience is solely dependent on which account you are placed on and under which management. Embarrassing and uncomfortable lack of diversity, both in background and demographics. Very little feedback. NY office is not for the weak-minded--you have to be aggressive or you will be left out to dry.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Provide much better structure for feedback at all levels. Make an effort to invest in your employees and make sure that the mid and lower level managers are carrying the same values as you.</advice-to-management>

“Wonderful Firm!”

</title><pros>Pros – The people, the leadership team and human resources leadership in D.C., the fact that most of the leaders care about employees, listen to employees and make it a pleasure to come to work every day. There's also a good client service focus, as there should be. Quality work is done and demanded. People are held accountable for behaviors for the most part.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the leaders outside of the DC office are not always honest and collaborative. There is far too much politics and back-stabbing.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Live the firm's values and treat people with respect, be honest about performance and growth opportunities. Pay attention to senior leaders in the DC office and broaden their responsibilities. They have a lot more to offer the firm. Stay privately owned. Payclose attention to talent you don't want to lose. The warning signs are there but you must pay attention and let them know they are important to the future of the firm.</advice-to-management>

“top firm”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has the best reputation among PR firms within the industry - and that shows when working there. Thought leadership, employee training and career development are all opportunities afforded by working for a privately held company that reinvests its profits.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman is a large company with the usual amount of bureacracy and company politics. It's a place where you need to know what you want and go after it agressively - no one holds your hand.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Invest in your people as much as you invest in your clients. Make retention a priority. Work to make titles and salaries consistent across the company based on determined expectations in terms of experience.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – The Edelman team is open and willing to help learn about what I should do as well as any other questions I may have.  I love the work environment because everyone seems to enjoy what they do.  We work really hard, and play hard.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Even as an intern I noticed a lack of organization in the upper management.  For example, there was no one site to find all active clients and contracts so it took a long time to track things down.</cons>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get control of the workgroups' tendencies to gossip, it's had a terrible effect on morale. Try to hire a more balanced workforce, too many men or women makes for a culture dominated by the worst traits of either gender</advice-to-management>

“The gold-standard PR agency is not all roses”

</title><pros>Pros – Smart people at all levels, some interesting clients, can be intellectually rewarding at times</pros>
<cons>Cons – It an be a very political atmosphere -- your career advancement depends more on the manager you end up with and your willingness to play "smoke and mirrors," rather than your actual abilities and performance. The work can be very tedious if you find yourself stuck on certain accounts, and it is very difficult to move internally to something you might like better.</cons>

“Ouch,  that hurt”

</title><pros>Pros – Ability to do things you may have never done before if you get a good account. Lots of variety of tasks, challenges and the opportunity to participate nominally in minor decision making.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No real teams here, rather it is individual competition within the team, Politics in the office is not the best way to help clients. Really poor leadership and  stratified management style. Very Old School. There is definitely an inner circle, a need to know attitude and poor morale overall all.  This agency is about billable hours and you better not forget it. You can grow there if you can get "in" with  certain people, not by accomplishments. I was disappointed and disillusioned, They had good PR about their company, I chose them over another but regretted it within my first week.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Empower and enhance all your employees, not just your buddy pool. Flatten  your management system and  instead of lunching with a reporter etc.. every day maybe Richard should lunch with employees.  Provide better platforms for employees to advance.

“Great place to work, not for pay”

</title><pros>Pros – As a young professional you will learn an immense amount of tools for successful media relations, writing and how to adapt to each client's needs.  Your growth is dependent on your hard work and managers are more like coaches that want to see and help you succeed.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman does not reward the hard work of it's employees with appropriate compensation.  The long hours it takes from employees to make Edelman a top agency doesn't seem to factor too much into the equation for management.  Many employees often feel overworked, overwhelmed and underpaid.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management should review its compensation policies and bring them more in line with appropriate levels.

Edelman encourages employees to embrace the changes in the practice of PR and gives them opportunities to develop their skills.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Office politics and gossip, while inevitable, can sometimes make the office a negative environment. Staff departures aren't always handled well. Workloads aren't spread very evenly, leaving some staff overworked while others have lots of free time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Do more to appreciate and recognize the work that junior staff perform. Encourage them to take chances and speak up with ideas and concerns.

“Unless you want to be overworked, underpaid and regularly backstabbed...don't work here”

</title><pros>Pros – You will learn a lot about media lists, media relations and social media while working here. This knowledge is very valuable. You will also learn a lot about office politics, which comes with a price but could be valuable eventually. Overall, the ultimate “pro” is that you will walk away with a major name in the PR industry on your resume.</pros>
<cons>Cons – To name a few cons, Edelman Seattle is full of poor management, favoritism and toxic people. If you are not a favorite of the general manager, upper management or HR don’t expect to get a promotion, a raise or even be heard when you have an issue. If your manager feels at all threatened by you and your talent, you will be demeaned in front of upper management and clients, not promoted for reasons you will only find out during your review and will be positioned by your manager as “not meeting the mark” (regardless of meeting/exceeding client expectations). Some other cons include low pay, long hours and very little appreciation.</cons>

“Good place to learn, challenging to grow if you're not the "right" personality”

</title><pros>Pros – There are many opportunities to learn and take on a variety of projects. There are also opportunities switch to difference practices.  Edelman also encourages having a life outside of work and experiencing new things - I really value that and would hate to work for a place that doesn't encourage these values.</pros>
<cons>Cons – To me, the louder you are, the more recognition and promotional opportunities there are. It doesn't always seem fair that you must be extremely vocal in order to be given new responsibilities. There does seem to be heavy favoritism at this office. Sometimes it's too big for junior staff to have the chance to dive in and take on more meaty projects and roles.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to the junior staff - we have good ideas too. Also, management needs to look at how people are evaluated and promoted. I was overlooked for not being outgoing enough - at least that's what it boils down to - while others with less experience were promoted at the same time I finally was. It didn't matter that I had great praise for the great work I was doing from everyone on the internal team as well as from clients.</advice-to-management>

“Great place to work...not a great place to earn money.”

</title><pros>Pros – Great work-life balance, plenty of professional development opportunities, open-door management styles and top-notch clients. Smart and accomplished co-workers. One of the few PR companies with long-term career potential for newbies, and excellent about promoting from within.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company is big enough that it can be difficult to get to a position of real influence. Furthermore, an employees experience varies largely based on the account they happen to work with, which is not uncommon for agency work. The real minus is the salaries. Unless you were brought on before the recession, chances are you're being paid below market.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Promotions, professional development opportunities and praise are excellent for morale and much appreciated. But if salaries don't increase when the economic situation stabilizes, there is sure to be a loss of talent to competing agencies.</advice-to-management>

“If I didn't work here I'd want to be a client.”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman offers the greatest variety and depth of public relations counsel in the agency realm.  I worked at Waggener Edstrom, as well as Hill and Knowlton and had vowed never to work in an agency again.  I began at Edelman as a part-time employee and was immediately impressed by the level of client service, support for employees and most of all by the senior leadership.  Having worked at other agencies, I was stunned by the personal involvement of c-level executives in helping clients on a day to day basis and winning new business.The value account teams deliver is unsurpassed (at least based upon the experience in my office).  All voices are valued and creative thinking is accepted at all levels.I realize this sounds a bit like a pollyanna, but is truly my experience.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The reality is that agency life isn't for everyone.   I do feel it is the best environment for learning and expanding your skill set.  I am grateful that Edelman is a private company because we can weather the tough times and keeping employees is a priority.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Leading a diverse and global company is not easy and it is difficult to maintain a company's culture.  I would encourage the leadership to support regional differences so that we can continue to provide the best local AND global support.</advice-to-management>

“Excellent company with outstanding values mixed with a fun and entertaining environment!”

</title><pros>Pros – I love what I do, I love the people I work with and I'm proud to be employed by Edelman.  The Seattle office is fun and hard-working.  Employees work hard and reap the benefits... senior staff does a good job of acknowledging and rewarding people who make solid contributions.  The office is casual, laid-back and endlessly entertaining, which makes me happy to be at work each day.  I don't think I've ever dreaded coming to work and the environment and people are the main reason why.

“Great reputation, not a great place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a place that is full of very smart people who, in my mind, are thought leaders in the PR industry. The training and education they give to employees is truly valuable and overall the clientele is very interesting. Beyond thought leadership and great clients, they have beautiful offices around the U.S. that are aesthetically pleasing to walk into every day.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Upper management shows extreme favoritism to those who fit a particular mold. They will promote them relentlessly and noticeably allow them to micromanage the rest of the team (regardless of their title). If you are not one of their favorites, upper management will always find a reason why you shouldn’t be promoted and not give you a constructive reason why you cannot move to the next level. Aside from there not being an opportunity for career growth  here, the pay is terrible. I am making 10 to 15 thousand less than my counter parts in other firms, and do not have any benefits like compensated travel (parking, bus, train) or a reduced rate on a gym. Aside from all this the people truly make this place miserable. They are passive aggressive, arrogant and will do anything they can to take credit for good work they did not do. I would not recommend working here.</cons>

“Be prepared to work hard; you'll get out what you put in.”

</title><pros>Pros – When you're starting your career in PR or communications, there isn't a better place to be for meeting others in your shoes, finding mentoring opportunities and getting connected with others in the industry. The company is great about offering internal education and growth opportunities to young professionals, and really invests a lot in making sure they've got the best of the best as far as workforce goes.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very hierarchical, and very political. If you don't play the game it's wisest just to get out.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Often the support or solicitations for feedback from younger staff members came off as feeble or obsequious. It pays to actually *listen* to junior staffers.</advice-to-management>

“PR Week's 2009 Agency of the Year for a Reason”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a creative powerhouse. Whenever I need some unique options to present a client, I round up a selection of colleagues from various parts of the company to brainstorm ideas - our collective creativity never fails to impress me! Edelman's medical benefits are superior to other companies' (though not all employees appreciate this.) Also, new hires automatically get two weeks vacation, PLUS what amounts to other week in optional/balance days. And that is on top of 10 standard holidays, including  MLK and Presidents' Day. Another great advantage of working at Edelman: we're an independent company so we're able to invest in our future, our services and our people the way many Wall Street-beholden firms can't. Finally, you can't overlook the fact that Edelman was named PR Week's Agency of the Year in 2009.</pros>
<cons>Cons – We're working hard to get better at this, but teams in different practice areas and geographies do not share information effectively. This is partially driven by Edelman's entrepreneurial culture (everyone wants to own their own little piece of the company) and by the way our P&L is structured. Speaking of structure, Edelman has few processes in place compared to other companies. In some ways, this helps us make decisions more quickly and with greater flexibility; however, we often end up duplicating efforts or wasting time tracking down information that should be readily available. Our financial processes (or lack thereof) are a great example; however, we are rolling out a new global financial system this year that I am hoping will make billing MUCH easier for us and for clients.</cons>

“Great opportunities for mid-to-senior management, but junior staff is overworked and underpaid.”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a well-known firm and has a strong creative staff. The agency also has an extensive list of clients across a number of practices including technology, healthcare, consumer, etc. The company does a good job of staffing accounts across offices and regions to take advantage of different expertises that vary across the country. The company also has extensive international offices that are helpful when clients need work done in foreign countries, need documents, translated or need access to press in foreign countries.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low pay for junior staff, and on large accounts the junior staff are not always given opportunities to experience different types of the business i.e. plan development, extensive media outreach, etc.</cons>

“Edelman: a superior place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – The company culture is wonderful, and teamwork, recognition and work-life balance are all priorities at Edelman. Promotions and kudos are given for jobs well done. Lines of communication are open between employees and upper management, and professional development opportunities are abundant. The company has top-notch clients and the work is interesting. Edelman University is one example of a unique company offering with great value--here, employees share knowledge, expertise and best practices to help aid professional development, quality and client satisfaction. Furthermore, Richard Edelman is a gracious and knowledgeable leader who communicates frequently with his employees and is always looking for and blazing the next breakthrough in the PR world.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Having a number of large accounts is a blessing because it allows you to focus your time on one thing, but it can also be a curse because it can narrow your scope of development. And the size of the company can make it difficult to get to the top.</cons>

“Edelman continues to lead the company down a global path.”

</title><pros>Pros – Well-established global company.  Stand-alone public relations firm with a number of specialty offerings in various offices around the globe.  These specialty offerings provide unique differentiators to clients.  The company has a good blend of young, new employees and more seasoned professionals who have been employed by the company for many years.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Small management group making decisions in a vacuum.  Family ownership may limit advancement for management personnel.  For most, the road from assistant account executive to senior management has many roadblocks.  Less seasoned employees may be required to spend a number of years working on tasks that are neither learning experiences now rewarding.  Senior professionals are often pigeon-holed into roles that neither give them the opportunity nor prospect of growth in other roles or with other departments.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – I enjoy the people with whom I work. It has a good portfolio of clients and a strong network across the globe.

Also, we have a pretty good softball team.</pros>

“Practice what you preach.”

</title><pros>Pros – Big company with small company values. Executive management really believes in the company and the senior leaders are inspiring, motivational and fun to work with. Employees genuinely seem to like each other, especially in the management ranks.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Silos. Leadership says they're different from the other large PR agencies, i.e. better cooperation, less competition between P&L's, faster decision making, less politics--but in reality Edelman is no different from any other large global PR firm. Edelman is somewhat conservative and buttoned up. Many people have been there a very, very, very long time and seem reluctant to do things differently, especially if the change is suggested by or reflected in the actions of a new employee.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Practice what you preach.

“Edelman Offers Creative, Cutting-Edge Work Environment”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is committed to keeping it's employees informed on the latest trends in the industry and creating a work environment that is creative enjoyable. There is a true commitment to client service and, while this might mean more work around deadlines for the employee, it means clients stick around---thus, I feel my job is secure and isn't going to another agency. My supervisor catches up with me whenever I seem even the slightest bit stressed so we can assess workload and determine how to better manage my time. This open line of communication encourages me to be candid with my supervisor about the progress of my projects, rather than please her throughout the time leading up to the project deadline with false status reports.Edelman is aware that PR can be a taxing profession. That said, they put their money with their mouth is in tackling this downside. Edelman is committed to healthy work-life balance. They provide breakfast on Mondays, fruits on Tuesdays and Thursday. Fridays they treat everyone to ice cream, many selection are healthy as well.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman can be a lot of work. There are days when I come into the office at 6am and don't leave until 7pm. More times than not, my supervisor will keep track of days like this and allow me to leave early. However, when the team enters a busy season, there is little relief. Because everyone is working hard to meet the constant needs of the client, there can be an unnecessary sense of immediacy. Certainly we want to service the client as best as possible. However, nagging emails from fellow account people can be frustrating and a waste of time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Rely less on internal spin and more on honest assesment. At the end of the day, using either method of communication leads to a job well done. I just think we might be able to do an even better job not worrying about hurting feelings and, instead, relying on pure, honest assessment.</advice-to-management>

“Phenomenal agency with some hangups”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has an excellent reputation in public relations. The Portland office is up-and-coming and making a big splash within the global company. The staff is fun and there are many talented people in the organization. Educational opportunities are abundant. Clients are among some of the best in their respective industries - Microsoft, Columbia Sportswear and Starbucks to name a few. The company has excellent benefits and provides flexibility during the work week with work from home options. Working for a large agency provides instant credibility for someone just starting out in public relations. Management involves interns at various levels providing for an excellent internship experience. An especially great place to work if you value a casual work environment including off color humor, inappropriate remarks and foul language.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Unfortunately interns are supervised by Account Executives (typically only 2 years experience). This role provides a first opportunity for an Account Executive to manage another person, which is good for the company, but its also a gamble as to whether or not the person is up for the task. Since each intern has only one supervisor and one main point of contact, it can ruin much of the experience to have someone who struggles communicating and leading giving oversight. My supervisor was unable to provide helpful feedback on work (struggled with people pleasing). Rather than teaching and instructing, my supervisor was passive and sidestepped issues instead of dealing with them head on. I had hoped for a tremendous learning experience, and it was, but Edelman also provided the worst boss I have had in 9 years of work.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Fun place to work overall with great people. There you have a very clear career path and managers are open to giving feedback and committed to helping you grow.

“Great culture”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman Portland has terrific culture. There is a fair amount of freedom to pick what accounts you want to work on, and to pursue new business that is personally interesting. The leadership of the office is very fun and spirit-oriented, which trickles down to make a caring, open atmosphere. Creativity and quality are highly prized, as is a general attitude of can-do, jump-in and help  even if it doesn't directly improve your own are of responsibility.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay at Edelman Portland is about mid-range compared with similar agencies. It could definitely be higher, especially at the most junior levels. Additionally, some account teams appear to be favorites of the senior management and get more attention and resources. It can be de-motivating to work on an account team that isn't a "pet" of senior management. Another aspect that could use improvement is training. The company tries to provide training, but it isn't terribly level-specific. While most account teams devote a good amount of training to the tactical aspects of junior level work, there should be more training around the areas of influence -- presentation training, client negotiation, etc.</cons>

“BEWARE! You are signing away your social life. No such thing as work/life balance here.”

</title><pros>Pros – Great reputation and looks great  on resumeEdelman has a vast amount of resources available for its employees, far more than your average public relations agency.Great client list, you represent some of the biggest and best brands/products in the world.Good work experience if you plan on climbing the corporate ladder.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Jr. level worked to the bone.  Be ready to be the first one in the office and the last one to leave at night.Office politics and "favorites" and cliques, but that goes for every officeIndependently owned but a very, very corporate setting. There is no room for any kind of individuality or even creativity when you are at a junior level.</cons>

“Great company, bad timing”

</title><pros>Pros – The people are great.  They are fun and real.  Also, there are some fun happy hours and out of the office activities.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is not great.  Also, due to the sinking economy, Edelman is hesitant to hire.  These leaves a lot of the employees with a larger than normal workload.  There is a definite need for new hires, but until the economy changes, the employees have to work longer hours for less pay.  From my experience, it seems that senior management and upper level management at Edelman doesn't do much actual work.  All of the work is transfered to lower level employees, stressing them out even more.</cons>

<cons>Cons – They are very picky, so you have to work really hard to stand out among your peers.

“Great for senior level; horrible for junior level; extreme office politics”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has a great reputation, as everyone knows, and there certainly is lots of room to grow (if you know the right people and are part of the circle of office elites). People at Edelman are incredibly smart and understand the various industries very well. The global networking for account servicing is unmatched.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is no work/life balance at Edelman. Junior level staff are highly disregarded no matter how much they burn the midnight oil to keep the accounts afloat. There are office politics to no end, and personal feelings/vendettas almost always trump professional merit.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Invest in your junior level staffers and don't take them for granted. Too often have I seen our junior level staffers just walked all over upon and stretched so thin. Yet, when it comes down to doling out recognition, the junior staffers hardly ever receive praise. Evaluate your senior level staff for effectiveness in team building and management because there are too many underserving people in senior positions while some amazing junior staffers are consistently overlooked.</advice-to-management>

“A great place to work and learn regardless of your level.”

</title><pros>Pros – Ahead of the curve in new technologies and the direction the industry is taking. A place you can be proud to work -- high profile clients and great work; a place you can shine. Easy access to senior management. Work/life balance varies but is not unlike any other agency. In-house training is important and available to all employees at all levels. Competitive compensation. As an independent agency without stockholders to consider, they are willing to do investment spending on new offerings to keep themselves cutting edge.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Very little communication within the agency as a whole. You know what's happening in your practice area but not in others. Not a place for everyone: to be successful you need to be aggressive.</cons>

“Hard work and long hours are standard here, but the payoff can be big for those dreaming of careers in PR”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is recognized as one of the world's leading PR firms.  You'll learn from some of the brightest in the business.  You'll also have the opportunity to work on some of the world's best-known brands that are held by companies with large marketing budgets.Richard Edelman, the company's head honcho, has a future-forward vision of the PR and marketing communications industry.  This vision echos throughout the hallways and trickles down to junior staff.The company has practice areas in nearly every industry and offices around the globe, which is a plus for those who may want to explore other areas of PR.</pros>
<cons>Cons – As in any advertising or PR agency, management is promoted based primarily on the ability to bring in new business or for the success/growth of current clients.  But a good PR person isn't always a good manager -- so there can be a culture of ineffective and inefficient management on some teams.Be prepared to work long hours and remain constantly tethered to the office and the client.  Client demands are high and the grunt work usually falls to the lowest of junior staffers.  High burnout (and high turnover) is very common here.  In my experience, turnover was higher here than at other similarly-sized marketing communications agencies; that's a red flag in a high churn-and-burn business.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Train your senior people to be better managers -- not just better new business rainmakers.  Grow your junior people -- give them solid projects but also help them to balance work and life so that the burnout rate isn't so high.</advice-to-management>

“Great clients, poor work/life balance”

</title><pros>Pros – Work for great Fortune 500 clients with interesting PR projects.  Had the opportunity to work on things that we cutting edge and drive measurable results for the client.  It is the best company in its field and the perks are great.  Since it is a privately-owned firm, it still has that smaller structure feel.  Not too bureaucratic in process and procedures.  Great benefits for a larger firm.  Summer hours were given as full comp days so most could take them because early summer hours were hard to take with the amount of projects at a time.  Great place for someone just starting career in PR.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No work/life balance, sometimes put in over 60 hours a week; lack of enough junior staff to support workload.  Too many tasks with too little people to implement.  Not very diverse in its workforce.  Deadlines were unrealistic on most projects and required long hours and even holidays.  Top management was poor in communicating employee expectations and feedback on projects.  Management would commit to more projects than team was able to implement at one time.  Account people were responsible with all aspects of business including monthly billing sheets which would take up to a day to complete depending on number of projects in process.</cons>

“Best Firm in the Business”

</title><pros>Pros – Mobility, flexibility, creativity - they all represent values inside the company that play out every day. It's a great environment that rewards those who work hard, values ideas and creativity regardless of their origin (mostly), and if you're willing to go after them - opportunities around the world. The agency treats its people like their most important piece of equipment, the core of its business, and demands that they're developed as such. And on top of the fact that it's a world-class communications firm, the simple matter of the independence is a game changer. There's no way I would work for another firm, certainly not for a publicly traded one as part of some large conglomerate.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It can be too easy to get wrapped up in the work. You have to be responsible for taking charge of your own life/work balance - no one is going to do it for you. At the same time, while not unique to business, PR, or life in general - there are times that personal relationships among senior staff can cloud or interfere with the best decisions for clients, the firm, or employees. As a whole, there is due consideration and diligence, but the exceptions can stand out - if only in stark contrast.Finally, again, not unique to large companies - the bureaucracy can be a little crushing at times.</cons>

“A good hedge school for learning, career development tricky”

</title><pros>Pros – PR focus - because the company was family-owned and independent from the ad agency monoliths, PR was front and centre of everything that happened. That meant is wasn't an afterthought.  It was a great place to "learn the trade".Early Adopter - Edelman understood digital and convergence very early on and was a pioneering company. It was sneered at by bigger global competitors but it showed foresight and reaping the benefits of today.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Family ownership - as above it can have advantages, but also disadvantages. The company had a "US first,  Rest of World second" mentality. Major decisions were made in the US and filtered through. Some global memos were cringeworthy and did not take cognisance of local cultures or values. Working in a European office felt like you were working in a franchise rather than part of a global team. Also, European executive positions moved like a carousel, leaders never seemed to stay long.Career progression -  This was a maze, without clarity. Very political and who you cosied up to. You had to push for promotion.</cons>

“Terrible”

</title><pros>Pros – Good values established from company founder.  You walk in and sense the family ethic, majority of people are friendly.  Decent benefits the longer you are with the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The good values are fading fast.  The place is full of managers thinking they are top VIP's.  The power has gone to their heads. Leadership unable to handle PR pressure and often shout profanities over conference calls or to assistants. Senior staff have no problem in being rude and will happily make you feel as if you can't do your job, terrible as your obviously there as you are fully qualified. You do get a sense that people openly gossip for a pass time.  Many middle-aged senior women seem like they could have been top editors or working in fashion PR and missed the boat. The creative division has tarnished the reputation of the company as the senior staff are erratic, many mood swings that makes it impossible for individuals to concentrate and work.  Very weak HR team. Induction is a booklet to read on the morning you arrive. Took nearly a week to get a second hand laptop set-up and basic blackberry. Terrible disappointment for a global PR firm.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Build a strong HR team.  Management should look at the reputation of the company and the people that are giving the place a bad name.  Address behaviour issues with senior staff and offer training/ counselling to heads of divisions to teach them ways of dealing with pressure, and how to treat people with respect.</advice-to-management>

“Is Edelman one of the best?”

</title><pros>Pros – As an English, native speaker there are numerous opportunities to interact with clients and manage projects in Beijing. An overseas education is something that provides a skill set which is unique among local staff, and, thus, helps you to stand out.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Frankly, the Beijing office operates more on guanxi (personal relationships and connections) than it does on hard work and success. It's a well known fact that foreign staff face greater challenges in being promoted compared to their local counterparts.Maintaining a good work-life balance is difficult.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Ensure that employees that do good work are recognized. The quality of work is not always determined by the hours someone works.Work on employee satisfaction and retention. In particular, pay attention to ensuring that your employees have a work-life balance. Too many colleagues of mine have quit because they've been forced to work overtime nearly everyday.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – The Canadian offices are going through some growing pains. I found staffing to be heavy on the Senior level and sparse where the actual detailed work needs to be accomplished. This equates to many consecutive long hours with no compensation. You may find yourself pigeon holed very quickly and looking elsewhere.</cons>

“Smart people, strong culture, solid place to build a career and reputation in PR”

</title><pros>Pros – Some of the smartest people I've ever met in PR. There's a reason Edelman has clients who have stayed with us for 10+ years. Working for this company, you never stop learning and you never stop growing. It's also very much a team environment. I've met some of my best friends while working here, and the people I work with are what make me want to come to work every day.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Senior management can be a little out of touch. They will occasionally make excuses for negative feedback, rather than dealing with problems head-on. Changing teams or practices is a difficult and lengthy process.</cons>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management definitely needs coaching. 24 and 25 year old managers at this company do not know how to be professional nor how to treat their employees well, with respect, so that they can grow and flourish.

“Two Thumbs Up”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a fantastic employer. You have a variety of accounts to work on that really help you hone your skills. Strategic thinking, being creative, and emphasizing measurement / ROI are key strengths of the firm, and what you are trained on from day one. Your colleagues are nice, smart, and many long-term friendships are forged, albeit from some late nights at the office. The career path is clear on how to progress up the ladder. What I especially appreciate is the trust Edelman gives to its employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is a lot of work, especially when you are employed in one of the big city locations, but if you want to work at a large global PR agency, it truly is second to none.</cons>

“Good Company to Work For”

</title><pros>Pros – Great culture, solid leadership, and good position as a market leader in the Digital Marketing space.  Edelman is a more stable, mature agency than many of the other Digital agencies.  Company has great brand recognition among enterprise clients, so it's not hard to get in the door with new target clients.  The company is also global, and encourages employees to move between markets (or even specialties) as their personal life goals shift.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Conflict arises as the non-Digital side of the business becomes increasingly threatened by the Digital.  Edelman is, at its core, a PR company, and while clients demand Digital as part of any enterprise-level solution, the PR side tends to want to pump non-Digital into the budget to stay alive.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Invest in "productizing" some of the mid- and entry-level Digital services, so that the PR staff can better qualify, position & sell them.  This will also help train up entry-level Digital staff to a consistent, high standard.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – Edelman seems to place more value on junior talent than senior talent, offering perks that appeal to 20-somethings (i.e., happy hours), but they fall short when it comes to perks for mid- and senior-level talent and retention at those levels.</cons>

“Excellent training program but total waste of good talent; myopic management and ineffectual HR”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman's training program is first-rate. There are online trainings and in-person workshops for all employees, and more rigorous training offerings for managers. Like anywhere else, if you are lucky enough to have a good manager, they will protect you and give you a good chance to thrive in your role. If you wind up with a client you're excited about, the work has the potential make you feel inspired and fulfilled.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The positive reviews on this Web site are so rosy, it makes this former employee wonder whether Edelman mounted a campaign to whitewash its GlassDoor profile.For a company that purports to be at the cutting edge of business communication, the actual staffing model is completely inadequate. Edelman is the stingiest company I've ever worked for, paying low salaries for work that is highly valued elsewhere. Any employee who leaves is likely to discover this almost immediately. Not even the first-rate training program makes up for that.Moreover, Edelman's top management is constantly squeezing more work particularly from junior staff, and tightening the screw further every quarter. In an effort to be as profitable as possible, most accounts lean heavily on junior people with only the token involvement of senior staff. It's common for the average foot-soldier within Edelman to be working on 4-6 accounts. It is not an environment conducive to high-quality work, rather it encourages middling work and is a surefire way to burn out staff and cause heavy turnover, which is exactly what happens. The junior staff bear the brunt of the belt-tightening but never benefit from it, as they usually burn out and leave long before they become a Vice President or above, the only positions eligible for the company's bonus program.Teams are not truly multi-disciplinary, because it would be more expensive to staff teams that way. There is an over-emphasis on traditional media relations skills, insufficient screening for basic writing skills, and no training whatsoever in graphic design or video production. The only exception is social media skills, which Edelman has attempted to diffuse throughout the organization with a unique training program. Unfortunately even the most embarrassingly basic social media programs are priced too high to be useful to most clients. The result is that for all but the major accounts, the company's services can seem a bit limited and behind the times.The culture at Edelman is uneven, with scattered safe havens and many hornets' nests. People who thrive in a highly politicized environment will move up quickly, regardless of their actual talent. You could spend years climbing this ladder, or just leave and move up much more quickly elsewhere.My advice to prospective employees: if the job appeals to you, if you really click with the interview team and if you can confirm that these will be the people you will be working with, it could be a good situation. Then stay long enough to learn the ropes and form some good relationships. But don't stay too long, because you are sure to be valued more elsewhere in the end.</cons>

“I love it here.”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a place to build a thriving career.  The culture is entrepreneurial, spirited, hardworking and (almost always) fun. The company rewards intelligence, creativity, innovation and high ethics. I've been on board six years and continue to learn new things and be given new opportunities every day.  It's the right agency for a self-starter who wants to be at the leading edge of communications, marketing and media.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's entrepreneurial and fast-moving, and involvement in agency initiatives, beyond the client work, is really encouraged.  While there are plenty of flex programs for telecommuters, parents, part-time work, etc, and a healthy respect for balance, it's just not a place for a 9 to 5'er.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – - Great experience as an intern with wide-ranging duties, interesting projects and big brand clients- Richard Edelman is an amazing CEO- Offices were really nice with a rooftop deck and nice perks in free Starbucks-A+ name on your resume</pros>
<cons>Cons – Almost none of the interns from my class were hired, and very poor communication from HR. There's a certain arrogance here, and it's really sad considering it's an amazing agency. Having interviewed and worked with recruiters at different big agencies, it's obvious Edelman HR doesn't care about  people and a stand-up hiring process - they do what is most convenient for them, even if it means ignoring communication from candidates. That may work well given the current unemployment rate, but it attaches a certain stigmatism to your company.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Being part of a medium-sized digital agency within the biggest global PR agency can offer non-stop opportunities with clients, but also can be a heavy weight on relatively few digital team members in comparison to the company at-large to address everything of interest to the PR businesses.</cons>

“If you're smart, hungry and want to elevate and drive your profession forward...Edelman's the place for you.”

</title><pros>Pros – --Smartest, most dedicated people in the industry who are in PR for the right reasons and genuninely believe in the tenets convening transparent, honest debate and engagement to drive client agenda forward.--Private firm with leadership committed to truly great work, not just great quarterly margins.</pros>
<cons>Cons – --For some, a culture where doing average or status quo work is seen as failure is not for them.--Executives are not allowed to rest on laurels and exalted hierarchy is not tolerated. Execs are all required to be hands-on and 'doing' the work, not directly.--I see these as HUGE positives, but I've had colleagues, new hires and recruits say that these are cons. Those folks tend to not last long.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep up what you're doing and don't let success go to your head. Stay hungry, focused on doing the BEST work in the industry and we'll continue to be the biggest. Dan Edelman said it first, but it's more true every day the bigger and better we get. Easier to say when you were challenging the 'big' guys.</advice-to-management>

“it was ok, some stuff left a bad taste in my mouth”

</title><pros>Pros – they have got a great eye for detail, high standards, offer opportunities to grow,</pros>
<cons>Cons – as a very junior employee, I was exhausted, long hours are expected. I had just started and yet they do not give staff teething time to settle in, one feels they are already being discussed at the coffee table by peers/ managers. Some of the tasks are very dull and they pounce on juniors with free time to get their tasks done.  seemed a bit cuthroat in some instances. Cliquey. There are people there in their early 30s who have been there since their early twenties and probably on over inflated salaries, very nervous that juniors should pull their weight.The economic downturn has made them nervous. Shame I left as I learnt a lot of good stuff but in the long run...it was not a good fit in terms of lifestyle or long run feel good organisation with a creative thought process and supportive learning culture at its heart.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – be more flexible, and supportive of juniors. Strip top level of so many overpaid managers. actually let staff leave at 5.30. They might actually be more creative. There was an element of big brother is watching which annoyed me. One had to report their every movement to the entire dept and junior staff are often managed by very young staff themselves who are insecure and put undue pressure on their subordinates.</advice-to-management>

“Friendly yet competitive environment with several professional growth opportunities.”

</title><pros>Pros – Several professional growth opportunities. Friendly colleagues. Experienced colleagues and resources to draw from. Promotes work/life balance.</pros>
<cons>Cons – While a work/life balance is promoted, it is hard to do. Possible career paths overwhelming to new comers. Day-to-day account positions have little to no contact with upper management - I know they work on accounts and the company, however I'm not sure what they actually do.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I think it would be helpful to have creative and fun bonding opportunities within offices. My former company had gatherings, tournaments, etc. for bonding time for just about every minor holiday or event (i.e. put-put course design and putting contest for the Masters, haunted house and costume party for Halloween, Track and field day, etc.) I could really see a difference in the team dynamic after these occassions and our team ran a lot smoother than what I have noticed at Edelman thus far.Second, I would like to say that I chose to work at Edelman because I hold the company in high regards. I am getting paid significantly lower than what I was offered at other companies. If Edelman could  at least match other offers in the area, I think Edelman could attract and retain talent better.</advice-to-management>

“For a time, It was a terrific place to visit but not a place to live...”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a marque name in the PR field; Edelman is to PR what Rolls-Royce is to cars.  There is no shortage of communications offerings; from crisis and issues management, CSR to branding and digital, it is certainly "one-stop shopping" with quality, ingenious work all around.  With it being a privately held company, there's no worries about dividends, superfluous buzz from NYSE analysts and the like; focus can be devoted to enhancing existing relationships with clients and new business prospects.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The first area of improvement is eliminating the "office politics" and keeping the egos of senior-level people in check...if that's even possible (also, some leaders just need to "toughen up" their pain tolerances more).  Edelman has brilliant people at the helms of many practice groups but are not always "generous" to their support staff.  They should go beyond minimum 3% increases and try making bigger spot bonuses more regular -- you'd be amazed at what those little things will do for morale.  Some executives and account staff take a dismal, almost dismissive view to administrative professionals.  I feel that if some had it their way, they would have the secretarial pool enter the offices through a back door not unlike the servants during the Antebellum South.  Another area of improvement -- from top leadership down to mid-level -- is to ease up on or outright eradicate petty issues with colleagues on a daily basis or during the annual reviews; going a full year without bringing up any areas for improvement and then bombarding your reviewees with numerous flaws is just poor form.  There will be days that go well and some will be better than others; that said, you -- like every living, mortal human being -- have to just roll with the punches and deal.  It may be beneficial for Edelman -- and perhaps other companies -- to foster a culture of modesty and humility to some extent.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It's simple.  Your job does have some stressful days and clients are NOT always reasonable (remember: they give you the six-seven figure budgets that partially feed your salary and you don't need a MBA from Harvard to know that) but do remember that all these pressures came with your highly exalted titles, yearly bonuses, offices with lovely window views and all the other sundry perks...not to mention paychecks that subsidize driving fancy Japanese or European cars, summer homes, exotic vacations, designer handbags and jewelry and living a life that many in this world don't have.  Bottom line: just try to keep all things in perspective on a daily basis.  Another thing: admin support in all it's forms -- secretaries, IT support, office services -- play a vital daily role in making the lives of staff quite comfortable and that needs to be remembered.  Otherwise, your workdays would be considerably longer...and, dare I say it, the mortality rate would be higher!</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Smart people. World class clients. Well respected within the PR/Digital industry. Some real thought-leaders work for Edelman Digital. Great resume builder.</pros>
<cons>Cons – At times I had up to five clients to account for at once. They do not care about your work life balance, and they'll pile more and more work onto your plate if you let them. For junior level staff, they are willing to give you high levels of responsibility, but not willing to pay you accordingly. Know what you're worth - you can do better.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Treat your employees fairly. It's as easy as that. The only people I know that LOVE working at Edelman Digital or Edelman in general are extremely Type A and don't care that their personal life and relationships suffer from this rat race job.</advice-to-management>

“From Intern to Assistant Account Executive - An Overall Great Experience”

</title><pros>Pros – One of the reasons I love working for Edelman is their focus on nurturing talent within the company. As an intern I was amazing at the amount of training and knowledge sharing available to employees at all levels. It's a great company to work for straight out of college!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Getting an interview for an agency of this caliber is incredibly competitive and I wish career counselors had stressed to me the importance of international work experience and language learning while I was in undergrad to prepare me for getting a job in this market.</cons>

<cons>Cons – > Can be very competitive and snarky at times> Could be more progressive about flex time and telecommuting> Too much favoritism shown by some managers, resulting in unmerited promotions> Can be arrogant and dismissive when we don't agree with the observations of others> Not diverse enough> Probably too top heavy</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Quit rewarding bad behavior. Just because someone can bring in money shouldn't mean they get to abuse others in the process. There's some bullying behavior here that needs to stop, but it won't as long as we keep promoting people based on dollars instead of how they obtained those dollars.</advice-to-management>

“It's all about the people and the ideas”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman has the best, smartest, most creative and most fun/interesting people in the business. This place is dynamic, evolving, forward-looking and unafraid of taking risks on new ideas.  The Exec Comm puts people and clients first and keeps a strong focus on growth, development, leading-edge thinking and quality.  I can see why many very talented people are attracted here and end up staying a long time, which is the best job perk of all.</pros>
<cons>Cons – All this entrepreneurialism can occasionally lead to new-idea overload, and you have to sort through what's really most important and how you can bring it to your clients.</cons>

“Great place to work (if you're fine with agency life).”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman places a heavy emphasis upon education and training, which is fantastic for more recent graduates.  Edelman also prides itself upon being the "best in class," which means it is always at the forefront of the newest technologies and trends of information dissemination.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Life at an agency means that the client's opinion very often guides what you do, regardless whether it results in the best work.  The heavy emphasis upon client satisfaction may translate to longer hours and sometimes tedious work for presentation purposes.</cons>

“An eye opening experience to be a junior staffer”

</title><pros>Pros – The mentoring progam allows you to learn more about the practices, clients and office politics without putting yourself in a compromising position. My supervisor is very aware of my workload and when things are piled, we communicate and adjust things so I'm not completely stressed out. The accounts I work on are far better than my peers at other agencies.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The hierarchy and cliques can make it difficult for a junior staff member to speak out and work collaboratively with others. Also, the immediacy of certain client needs are usually not that immediate. Senior level employees tend to promise the client deliverables before consulting with the junior level staff who actually produce those deliverables and many times this puts pressure on the junior staff to work on tasks that are impossible to accomplish.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Senior level staff should remember what it was like for them to be at the bottom of the totem pole.</advice-to-management>

“A behemoth of a PR company makes little room for innovation and creativity”

</title><pros>Pros – Edelman is a large company with many resources and a spectrum of high-recognition clients.  As a private company, there is less of a "roller coaster" during economic downturn which translates into security for staffers. Edelman is very good at its core competencies - media pitching/placing/ tracking. The sense of hierarchy is minimized within the offices, junior and senior staffers work side by side.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Edelman's specialty practices are weak and poorly structured.  Upward mobility is difficult for those outside of the traditional institutional structure (if you're not a manager, you're not going anywhere). Notoriously cheap with employees and projects.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Choose to be experts with our clients.  They are hiring Edelman for our expertise yet too often we let the client dictate process and create problems.  Too often, bad clients create bad work, a bad work environment and cost more than the monthly retainer is worth.</advice-to-management>
