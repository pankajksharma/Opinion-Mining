“I have had worse employers”

</title><pros>Pros – Security if you show up and do a good job. Most co-workers are fun and work hard.If you do a good job, you are encouraged to strive for more.  Educational assistance is available and you are encouraged to utilize it.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Secretive, cheap, mediocrity is acceptable. Talent is underutilized and attorneys will point the finger to staff if something goes wrong.  Turn over is high. High expectations for low pay. Training could be better, but everyone seems "too busy" to teach you well.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management has improved in the last few years. You get what you pay for. If you want quality staff, encourage them to stay by bonus or lunches or anything to show appreciation. Be more open with staff. Get the boss more involved in the day to day. It is hard to work for a ghost.</advice-to-management>
