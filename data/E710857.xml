“Long hours for a promise that leads to nowhere”

</title><pros>Pros – You will get to strengthen your skills with interacting with the public and entertaining large crowds. Your leaders, although calling you at all hours of the day, will try to work with you. It is possible to get to a leadership position but once you're there, it's extremely intense.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you expect to take care of loved ones or yourself with the pay here, look elsewhere. You will work an upwards of 60 hours a week and barely crack 500 dollars, and that's every two weeks. Your phone will ring nonstop from leaders who expect you to rattle off your goals all the time, making it very intrusive and almost to the point of harassment. Essentially you will work 7 days a week because even though there isn't a morning pep talk on the weekends, you have to participate in a conference call.Expect to drive long distances and not get compensated for it.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Tighten up. Get organized, especially with compensating for gas/mileage. Send out the schedules at least a week in advance, not two hours. Do not let "leadership" call unless you are at the Sam's Club actually working, not winding down for the night. Make morning meetings only once or twice a week instead of every day.</advice-to-management>
