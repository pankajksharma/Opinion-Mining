<employee-type>Marketing Director (Current Employee)</employee-type>
<title>

“Marketing Director”

</title><pros>Pros – The managers and other employees are very friendly. The work environment is professional and they provide all sorts of training so you feel comfortable promoting the products. I really like that they order lunch twice a week for the employees. The company has lots of opportunities for growth and learning new marketing strategies.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The working hours are sometimes more than what you expect. Some of their developers are not located here so we need to stay longer hours to be able to get in touch with them. But doesn't happen all the time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
