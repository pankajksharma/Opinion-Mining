“Back in the good old days”

</title><pros>Pros – Back when it was Coolsavings and the earl days as Q, it was a great place to work. Mgt was engaged, hard work was rewarded and it was truly inspiring to be a part of something that was growing.</pros>
<cons>Cons – After being acquired and systematically dismantled/devored by WorldAvenue (despite them taking the name), the wheels really fell off. Now there are only a handful of folks in the Chicago office and it is honestly hard to say what they are actually doing. It is hard to have a positive outlook for the company, but they have already dropped so far it's hard to imagine it could get worse.</cons>

“A tech company for MBAs”

</title><pros>Pros – Good location, friendly coworkers, appropriate pay.Semi-regular bonuses and raises, sometimes.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They have no interest in promoting competent, technically-minded individuals and instead let the slick-talkers and brown-nosers drive their technology department.  If you are looking for a tech job and are good at what you do, please go somewhere that will appreciate your work and give you the opportunity to pursue advanced titles and responsibilities.There is a reason they rename the company every few years.  It's former/sister companies include The Useful, World Avenue, Q Interactive, Selling Source.  This review applies to all of them.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – If you work at The Avenue Interactive Source and the word "technology" in your title, you should probably read a few books with the same.</advice-to-management>

“Unfair”

</title><pros>Pros – Good benefits, creative flexibility and a generous break room.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Promotions and job recognition is given to management favorites and whether there is a budget and a "need" for a position, rather than an employee's good, hard-earned work. A lot of office politics, cliques and micro-management. There are also too many managers for the number of employees within a department. There is no opportunity to advance, learn new things or grow professionally.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Break up the office "cliques" and reward/recognize an employee for their good work. That in itself would boost production, morale and make the company more successful overall. Petty office gossip and playing favorites is proven to lower production and quality of work. Also, giving the employees the opportunity to learn new things would be beneficial to both the employee and the future of the department. Furthermore, anyone promoted to a management/senior position should be sent to a management class on how to properly handle and interact with other employees.</advice-to-management>

“Declining Company In Need of Strong Leadership & Improved Technology”

</title><pros>Pros – The people are genuinely nice.</pros>
<cons>Cons – In response to the previous review titled "Energetic agency with outstanding...." This statement is no longer accurate. Since new management, there has been a steady decline of customer service, product management and creative. Technical errors were on the rise due to the outdated technology platform the entire company was required to adopt. There were no plans to update, upgrade or change to a newer, automated system which is desperately needed.No training programs, no clear individual goals or path of employee growth. Poor communication from management team with constant "I don't know" answers when asked about bonuses or promotions. Certain promotions & raises given without announcement. If employees have earned promotions and raises they should be announced to show that there is growth and advancement.Far from the Red Line transit station? The Chicago office is 1 block away from the Red Line.</cons>
