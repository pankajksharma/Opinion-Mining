“Good, Bad, Ugly”

</title><pros>Pros – The compensation and benefits package was great as were most of the fellow employees. There was a lot of comraderies depending upon which clients you were assigned to.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is a great lack of communication from senior management on the things that could affect your work life.  A lot of looking at numbers and not what actually what the worker bees are accomplishing.  When the workers see but are not told what is going on it's demoralizing.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You are in the communications business, learn to communicate.  Members of the leadership need to really know what and how work is being accomplished.  Sometimes the numbers do not tell the entire story.</advice-to-management>
