“Nice place to grow”

</title><pros>Pros – Good work enviorment and good leadership skills.  Good efforts to make their employees feel welcome.  The company spends time and money to make sure you are trained on the latest and greates software packages.  They also put money into equipment to make sure you are not fixing plotters or printers.  The admin. staff is very helpful and supportive.  The HR department is constantly making you feel welcome.  They also do anual company events to promote communication and even celebrate birthdays.  It is a small company that puts their employees first and it doens't take long to notice this at RCMA</pros>
<cons>Cons – Small work force at times leaves you feeling over worked.  At times working for numerous projects managers leaves you feeling torn between jobs.  They could be more efficient with tasks and sometimes things get done numerous times, but you will have this at most companies.  The location isn't the greatest if you live in a more populated area and sometimes they are slow to have you take on a more leadership role in the company.  The office is very nice with a good feel to it that doesn't make you feel traped.  They could be a little more clear when it comes to what time you should bill on your timesheet and you often confused when doing your time.</cons>
