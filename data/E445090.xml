“Great company culture”

</title><pros>Pros – i_SW offers a great working environment. Good benefits, family-friendly culture (working from home and flexible schedules), and really friendly people. The technical staff is top-notch, and the company does a lot of work in interesting areas</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you're used to working for one of the big contracting companies (BAH, Boeing, Lockheed, etc), then working for a smaller company like i_SW may be an adjustment.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>

“Great benefits.  Poor management in an unprofessional environment.”

</title><pros>Pros – More opportunity for growth because it is a small company.  Technical staff is very intelligent and their compensation package is solid.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The environment is very unprofessional.  The standards that are expected at any other professional services firm are not found here.  There are many emotional and erratic people there.  It's frustrating, there's a lot of favoritism and gossip - kinds of things that employees are protected from at most companies.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Work on creating standards of practice, respecting employees and reprimanding behavior that is unacceptable.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>

“company has potential but poor leadership and lack of standards”

</title><pros>Pros – The benefits are really great.</pros>
<cons>Cons – if you're accustomed to working in a professional environment at a mid to larger sized company, you'll have to change your expectations.  there are no standards in place or accountability for actions.  a VP who brings in business has free reign to do whatever he wants based on emotion.  this behavior would not be tolerated in a large company.</cons>

“Fantastic family-atmosphere place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – i_SW is growing rapidly and is positioned to take advantage of many current and future government IT labor type contracts. The people here are easy-going, but hard-charging and some of the best in the industry. There are many opportunities for growth. As the company is still a small business, there is great potential to get in on the ground floor. Daily interaction with the leadership is commonplace.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If one wants a more structured environment similar to a large business like a Lockheed or Boeing, you will not find it at i_SW.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management makes great attempts to keep the pulse on the company without micro-managing. The employees truly do have a say. There are no secrets here.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
