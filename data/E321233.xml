“Work elsewhere”

</title><pros>Pros – They will hire anyone competent and willing to do the work and accept the low pay, labor, lack of future opportunities, lack of benefits and safety hazards. However, you could not find better people to work with. Aside from the cons listed, the work environment is great. Also, job security is great.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low pay, lack of benefits, physical labor, safety hazards, lack of future opportunities</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – People leave Refrac because they don't get enough from Refrac. Cutting small corners on costs that are a burden/annoyance to employees is disrespectful. It's a sign of being undervalued.</advice-to-management>
