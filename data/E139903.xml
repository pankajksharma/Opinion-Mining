“Avoid i-Mate and CEO Morrison at all costs! Totally without scruples.”

</title><pros>Pros – It provides a paycheck. Other than that, working with Windows Mobile and handsets is interesting work. Benefits were decent.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company is run like a hobby by the CEO. As a company, they have no integrity in dealing with their customers; no dedication to producing a quality product. I firmly believe that their business model consists of sell once to a customer, and drop support immediately folling the sale. The work environment was extremely unpleasant and unprofessional, with the CEO and senior manager ruling by threat and intimiation.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Treat your employees as partners in trying to make the company successful. Get a "real" business manager to act as President. Someone who actually has a business degree and relavent profession background.</advice-to-management>
