“Great career, not so great agency.....”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a very rewarding line of work to be in and there is a lot of personal satisfaction in just doing your job well and making a difference in peoples lives, often playing an integral role in saving lives.  It is THAT good!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Last minute schedule changes, long hours....those are just something you accept when you get into this line of work.  Unchecked incompetence from coworkers and management are NOT acceptable, there is too much at stake at any given moment.</cons>
