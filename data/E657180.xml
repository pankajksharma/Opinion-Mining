“Great Company and People”

</title><pros>Pros – Competitive pay, decent benefits, family owned, management stresses self reliance and independent thinking and problem solving instead of micro-managing.  Flexible scheduling when needed.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Company is small enough that economic bumps in the road can drastically effect bottom line.  Small company with heavy HR policies that you normally see in corporate organizations.  Very limited growth or promotion possibilities.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
