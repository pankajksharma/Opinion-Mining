<employee-type>Dubbing Editor (Former Employee)</employee-type>
<title>

“No room for growth, and no work structure”

</title><pros>Pros – As an editor in dubbing team, we always on the move, able to know more about dubbing process, interact with voice talents, sound engineers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Mediocre benefits offered (8 days leave, RM 50 per month medical, RM 100 parking payment per month), no job description provided, no HR, weak management, no room for career advancement.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – This is the first company I ever worked without HR. Everything is handled by the 'big boss', so basically you have no one to turn to voice out any comments or problem. The workplace environment is not conducive for those who are looking for career advancement, or higher pay.I would recommend1. Restructure the workflow, i.e one editor in-charged for each studio. Give editors the chance to learn and become the directors, to ensure high quality deliveries, and work alongside sound engineers. Don't place the editors at the lowest of the rank, and point fingers at them when something isn't right. Revise the workloads of editing. Too long hours of editing will compromise the quality.2. Hire admin exec to respond in time and in-charged of work-related queries, printing etc.3. Inculcate the culture of learning and being supportive. Establish mentor-mentee program for newly-hired. This will reduce the turn-over rate of your company.4. Practice effective meeting. People are afraid to voice out their disagreements/opinions because of you, Mrs Boss.5. Abolish unnecessary culture of "Reply-All" e-mails.</advice-to-management>
