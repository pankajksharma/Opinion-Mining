“Incredible people, innovative products, outstanding leadership team”

</title><pros>Pros – On-X has an outstanding mechanical valve product line, soon to be the best mechanical valve in the business once the clinical studies are concluded.  The company is stocked with 20 and 30 year industry veterans that are the best in the world at what they do.  Sharp engineers are spinning off many new concepts, and On-X has the leadership and the resources to execute a great many of these new technologies.  Truly an exciting time for the company, it will be very interesting to see what happens in the next few years.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Still the underdog compared to many of the industry competitors (St. Jude, J&J, Gore, Medtronic, etc), forces the outsourcing of some of the functions necessary for a launch-able product line.   Not really a con, just a limitation of a smaller company in this industry.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You are doing an excellent job; communicating the vision, hiring the right people, allocating appropriate resources and training, developing appropriate new projects.  As sales increase and the company grows, look to enact retention programs to keep the best and the brightest and ensure future growth.</advice-to-management>
