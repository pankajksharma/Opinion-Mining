<employee-type>Bookkeeper (Current Employee)</employee-type>
<title>

“Horrible place to ever work in!”

</title><pros>Pros – Free food lol and discounts on the downlow of course.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is no potential career growth in here. The most you can become is bookkeeper which just does not motivate someone to work harder. The manager is a complete a hole who expects you to flirt with him and kiss up to him. God forbid you ever get on his bad side!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Quit being so full of yourself! and listen to your employees once in a while on how the place can be improved.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
