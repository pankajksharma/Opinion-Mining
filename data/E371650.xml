“A toxic place to work.”

</title><pros>Pros – The hours are somewhat flexible.  The location is good.  Many of the staff are friendly and nice to work with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Administrators take most of the responsibilities and blame for upper management. Loyalty is not rewarded fairly. Upper management rules by fear, yelling and intimidatin.  Many of the staff have not enough experience to be working there.  There is no real HR department; just a person who watches everyone and is mainly an assistant to upper management. The managers receive lots of special treatment like golf tournaments and hockey tickets but the lower staff is not included.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be grateful for the hard work your admins do. They are important and should be appreciated instead of treated like a pain.  You should trust your admins to work the hours they are required and not check up on them all the time. Put someone who knows how to do the job in charge of the other admins. Not someone who only knows the right things to say to upper management and works super long hours.</advice-to-management>
