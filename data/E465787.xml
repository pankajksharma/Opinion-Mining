“A good step into the IT Channel world”

Its very uplifting when you work for a company who carry a unique solution in the market.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Work life balance just wasnt there. Although the system allowed us to work uder low overheads, the company, whilst I was there, was just not doing enough to support the growth.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – They understood the requirements of the company but didnt really get a grasp nor actioned the needs of the employees who performed. I guess, if anything, my advice would be to putmore value in that area.</advice-to-management>
