“A great experience that I'd recommend to anyone.”

</title><pros>Pros – This was a great environment to work in. I learned a lot of skills and had a lot of variety in my job. The staff are super friendly and make working there an amazing experience</pros>
<cons>Cons – Company's first experience in the food industry. Owned by ACR Homes, there were a lot of different opinions as to how to run a coffee shop. Given that it was a privately owned coffee shop, there isn't much room for growth.</cons>
