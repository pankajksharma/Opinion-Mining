“Life as a merchandiser for KL Dist.”

</title><pros>Pros – Some of the Pros with working for K & L Distributers is that they give you a gas card in which you fill up your vehicle with gas on the first and third working day of your work week, whether it's Mon-Fri, Wed-Sun, Fri-Tues, etc... They also give you $440 a month (on top of your hourly wage) for car allowance if you are a full-time (40 hours plus) employee.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the Cons with working for K & L Distributors is that you have to drive your own vehicle (which ruins your vehicle after so many miles of driving). They seem to treat merchandisers with very little respect and they don't give feedback as to how well your job performance is. They only notice the negative things and seem to look over good, honest, hard workers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please open your eyes and try to notice who are really the hard workers within the merchandisers. Stop playing favorites and really please try to notice that some merchandisers need to be promoted for their level of work (high quality) they put in. Thank you.</advice-to-management>
