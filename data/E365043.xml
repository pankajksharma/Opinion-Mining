“Nice place to work but not for growth.”

</title><pros>Pros – Has a small company atmosphere. People are friendly. There are quite a few people in the company who have been there for over or near 10 years.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Company is run as if it is a small agency even though it is not. Leadership leaves you scratching your head many times. Chance for advancement is minimal. Professional growth is a challenge because there are no mentors in the agency that stay long enough to take on an apprentice.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be transparent; and at the same time understand you are the leaders and everyone does not always have to be part of the decision process. Recognize it is not the 80's anymore and pay people the salary that is competitive to the market and their skill set.</advice-to-management>
