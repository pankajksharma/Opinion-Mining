“Worst experience in any company ever”

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible with hours, had health benefits even when there was not enough work for full time hours, this is how I got my foot in the door of the e-discovery industry</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not enough work for full time hours after being promised it was a 'recession proof industry', many employees would sit and play games even when there was work to be done, very few actually pulled their own weight. Lots of people were paid to sit around when others were struggling for enough hours to pay rent. Very unprofessional management, not sure how things are going now but when I was there, things were very dismal</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
