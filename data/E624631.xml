<title>

“Like a Cult.”

</title><pros>Pros – - Staff are allowed to make decisions and are provided more autonomy than at other firms- Clients are very nice- Managers are very technical and know their stuff- Everyone has offices, limited use of cubicles</pros>
<cons>Cons – - The partners can be very mean, at times may yell at you for mistakes.  Not just yell, but yell and curse at you.- If you try to leave the firm, the partners may consider it a personal attack rather than a business decision- Compensation is not consistent with Industry- They do primarily Construction, so it requires a specific technical understanding.  This also means they have been hit hard by the downturn in this industry.  Compensation and benefits reflects this.</cons>
