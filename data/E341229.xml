They may decide to not to give a pay raise because no company in Technopark has given a pay raise.7. No option to Work From Home.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management should make their policies a little bit more employee friendly and should make sure that all employees are getting what they deserve. Rather than recruiting a lot of inexperienced people, they should try to retain their critical resources, otherwise it is going to be a mess, as most of their accounts depends on these resources.</advice-to-management>
