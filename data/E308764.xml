“Tight Team and Excellent Growth in Culinary Skills”

</title><pros>Pros – - One of the most knowledgeable, creative chefs in Nashville, supported by two highly skilled sous chefs.- Diversity of local meats, dairy, and produce- Constantly evolving, changing seasonal menu- Small, independent business without the restrictions and formality of corporate chains</pros>
<cons>Cons – - It's more like an internship (low-pay)- No benefits except vacation days- A somewhat stereo-typical temperamental, hierarchal kitchen</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You offer a challenging and empowering work environment. Regular, straightforward communication about issues in the kitchen is an intentional effort that I had never experienced before.However, communication between FOH, BOH, and other departments is often strained and even disrespectful. It would be wise to ensure that all team leaders model openness in communication between departments.</advice-to-management>
