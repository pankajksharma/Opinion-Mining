“Run Away from the Company...This is one of the worst places to work!”

</title><pros>Pros – The Real Estate Department is wonderful.  Organized, well-run, great to work with... No one in that department is in serious need of mental health medication.  The upper management will occasionally buy lunch.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The Oil & Gas/Energy Department is extremely poorly run.  The upper management is unorganized and unable to accept responsibility for their errors, poor work ethic, poor behavior and unprofessionalism.  This is the most vicious place I have ever worked.  The accounting department had errors on my paycheck more often than not.  The upper management changes your time sheet for the hours you worked on a whim and without your knowledge or approval.  They are the most unprofessional, poorly run law firm I have ever been at or heard of.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Keep the number of employees you maintain under 15 so that you are not governed by Federal Employment Law guidelines.  It will keep you from the majority of lawsuits for your treatment of employees.</advice-to-management>
