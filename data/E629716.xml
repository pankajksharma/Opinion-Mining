“Aggressively worked and underpaid--unbiased review”

</title><pros>Pros – Weekly Paycheck, merchandise discounts, free funeral if you die of exhaustion</pros>
<cons>Cons – Extremely pushy, the company headline should be "Get the money", raises are far and few, unethical sales tactics</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Due to the huge profit margins of the diamond industry, you should consider paying your employees either commission bonuses or a higher hourly pay. The hourly pay is similar to a Sears cashier. Think about your employees before your profits.</advice-to-management>
