“A very good place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – Great environment, the management is very personable and interactive.   You will have an opportunity to learn about the industry and the company regardless of what role you are in.   The leadership of the company believes in getting good staff and treating them well.I have never heard a bad thing said about the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is family owned, so don't plan on becoming the president, and that is about the only downside.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The only thing I could advise is to be less concerned about who see's the financial statements, your staff is good and loyal, I doubt you need to worry much.  Other than that, keep up the good work.</advice-to-management>

“Once a good company...Suffering under bad leadership”

</title><pros>Pros – The company is small (about 150 employees) so it's easy to be a big fish in a small pond. And most of the managers allow for some flexibility in their employees' schedules. Compensation & benefits are average.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The leadership of the company is mediocre at best. Lack of processes, accountability and poor training cause constant confusion and disruption. The corporate culture is extremely negative and morale is low. And because the company is small there are very limited advancement opportunities.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Have a qualifiied consultant that does not have a personal connection in the company evaluate the processes and highlight areas for improvement then implement the suggestions and reinforce them consistently.Invest some time into the growth, training and professional well being of non-management personnel. Happy employees are more productive and a lot less expensive than the high turnover common at MHC.</advice-to-management>
