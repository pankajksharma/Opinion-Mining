“Good company that is working hard to grow and still maintain a family atmosphere.”

</title><pros>Pros – Discount on furniture; people generally get along with each other.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No room to grow; limited opportunities for women in management; timely feedback not given when necessary; not working to promote from within; bringing in all outsiders when vacancies occur.  A great deal of change lately causing uncertainty amongst the employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Make sure the outsiders you are hiring are not discounting the existing employees under them as they wouldn't be there if they were not a part of the successes the company has enjoyed over the years.</advice-to-management>

“Superior product, fairly good sales training, supportive management”

</title><pros>Pros – Quality product and Made in America! Good sales training if you are dedicated to learn.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you are a sales associate - Low pay= part-time only if you work in corporate stores. Sales Managers/Store Managers good pay-Store Designers have huge and unrealistic sales margins to meet and cannot make a decent wage for the hours they work. Sales associates get pay increases yearly starting at .025 cents per hour...Not enough job promotion from within company. Need more sales/design training on a regular basis, and skip the scare tactic of hiring a "Mystery Shopper" to critique sales staff on their sales/training skills.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hire from within. Update looks with more modern lines and fabrics. Better wages with health insurance coverage for all! Have a more open dialogue to communicate with corporate designers with issues with design ideas and flaws seen everyday from the sales staff prospective. Would like to see some type of sales incentives and spiffs since the pay is low and there is no real incentive to sell since the commission pay structure was abolished and replaced with part time only for sales associates. Too many sales...too many sales.....</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – - Great base salary- Established company- Equal opportunity employer</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Confusing bonus pay structure- Long, demanding hours- No proper training- No opportunity for growth- Forced to work on days off- Forced to take calls on days off- A job, not a career</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Establish a proper training course instead of just throwing your workers to the wolves and expecting them to learn everything on their own.

“Interior Designer”

</title><pros>Pros – Laid back environment, built good customer relations and confidence in selling</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not much positive reinforcement, long hours, felt like I cared so much for the company but didn't get much respect back</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't treat your store employees like slaves--without them, you don't make any money.I don't see this company having their own stores for much longer.  La-Z-Boy will be around forever, but as individual stores trying to compete with other companies that sell the same product for less money, I don't see how they're making any profit.</advice-to-management>

“Interior Designers: Horrible Hours! 60-Hours Per Week!”

</title><pros>Pros – La-Z-Boy is a good place for interior designers who are new in the field to gain experience and pad their portfolios. The company offers a base salary for designers ($28,000- $30,000) that is better than competing furniture stores that employ designers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you have a family or a social life, La-Z-Boy is not going to be a good company to work for. La-Z-Boy stores are open every day of the week, from 9am until 9pm, and you have to work 60-hours per week as a company-wide mandate.At each store, there are only 4 full-time employees: the store manager, two sales managers, and one designer. Each full-time employee, at every store, is required to work 60-hours per week, but are only paid for 40-hours. This has been going on since December 2012. We were told the hours would go back to normal in May 2013, but they never did. A lot of full-time employees have either quit or suffered marital/familial problems as a result.Everyone is paid for what other people do, and no one "is" what they "are". If you have slackers on your team, you will not be able to succeed. Also, no one is just their position. For designers, even more important than designing beautiful rooms is to SELL. You are basically expected to be a a salesman with good taste.It is hard to make a good living unless you are at a high-volume store, such as Northern Virginia, Pittsburgh, So Cal, or Chicago. In my interview, my Market Sales Manager told me that with the volume at my store, I should gross $3,000/month in bonuses (AKA commission) in addition to my salary. I have never once made that much. I average $700/month. Based on what my MSM told me, I was expecting to make over $60,000/year. Unfortunately, the way it breaks down, I basically make less than $12/hour.Additional things to consider:-As a designer, you will put a LOT of milege on your personal car. I bought my car in October and have put over 20,000 miles on it just in work-related travel.-You have to front the cost of things like supplies, gas, food for clients, etc., and wait to be reimbursed.-You will NEVER get to see your family. Be prepared to work 9am-9pm. A lot.-You're never thanked or congratulated for anything. Only harped on when you don't do as well as others.</cons>

“Fair, Fun, Fantastic!”

</title><pros>Pros – The staff at the La-Z-Boy in Brookfield, Ct are very friendly and very helpful. You also make no commission which for anyone starting out in sales in a huge plus. There is always room for advancing positions in the company. No one is on your case about being low in sales which is always a plus.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not making commission or any other type of bonus as a sales person is discouraging for your efforts. Sometimes under the discretion of management they might have little in-store contests to make a little extra money but nothing serious. The only way you can make commission is being a sales manager. Sales people only work part time.</cons>

“All work and no play”

</title><pros>Pros – Decent salary, good benefits, working with clients designing rooms and small opportunity to bonus</pros>
<cons>Cons – Micromanagement beyond belief, minimum 50 hours a week if not more. Work every weekend every holiday. No time for family life, not ideal for parents with small kids. Non comission but they will work you like a dog for every penny. I am no stop at work taking up to 8 to 10 ups. Each presentation can last a hour to two hours. Half an hour break and I never get to take a 15. All the work is done by sales managers and associates while manager are rewarded for performance. There is an opportunity to bonus but you must exceed by 111% it's hard enough to get to alerts 80%. Gossip, rumors and lies with in the market. Very hard to get promoted, must wait at least a year to 2 years. It's unfortunate but you have to wait for some to quit, get fired or moved up for a promotion.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – No more nine to nines, give your mangers every other weekend off, culture is to live life with comfort. But I can't even buy a laz boy with my salary. There is little emphasis on your family life.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Internal grown, the furniture is a name brand so it's easy to sell, and it really easy top quality. Co-workers are all nice, if not a little sassy. Very friendly environment. Great for those who want part time work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's nice that they have strive for internal growth, but in many locations there is such a lack of opportunity to grow. We had weeks at a time where our store was just deserted. And why should I be so motivated to sell 10k work of furniture if I don't even make commission? Really corporate? Leave the sales aspect to retail.  They don't even allow you to work full-time. Struggling? Don't work here.</cons>

“Commission Base Sales Representative”

</title><pros>Pros – Excellent Product all you need is: People to walk in the Gallery that want to buy furniture and you to be a good La Z Boy  Sales Representative. You have to know your product and follow all the steps. La Z Boy is an excellent product you have to be proud of it flip a chair and show why is better than other imitations. You have limited life time warranties, 80%  of it is made  in USA talk about it!. I LOVE MY LA Z BOY, be proud and work all the programs. Your  Interior Design Program, your warranties and special orders these will make you money..Big Time Money . There 4 stores is a franchise company 2 out of 4, Sales Reps. Can make up to $70,000.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No frequent ads on local channels the ads are on the newspaper on a Sat. Unless Corporate runs the ads.  May be if the owner got a good deal for a Sunday ad he will do a Sunday ad.  Pay Structure changed 3 times in 2 years if you want to work for this company. Make sure you  ask all the right questions. Vacation is great to take off but you have to make sure you done your monthly goal so it won't hurt your numbers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Ads, local ads.  Product knowledge training is wonderful but what's the point of knowing all measurements, names & whats is in stock  and not asking for the sale?  If you hire people that never sold prepare a program for them, on closing a sale as well as product knowledge. Don't just throw them to the lions. Give them the tools and you will see, the improvement.</advice-to-management>

“Very Challenging and not very rewarding”

</title><pros>Pros – -Slow, relaxed environment-When your manager is not watching, you can sit in the chairs and sofas.- You get to meet new people</pros>
<cons>Cons – They let you know you are disposable from day one. Their management style is "If u don’t like it , there is the door!!" The employee turnover is unbelievable. The atmosphere is  highly demanding, takes no excuses expects the impossible. They pay less than McDonalds, Taco Bell or WalMart. Cleaning toilets and scrubbing floors is not discussed  in your interview but once hired is a everyday  thing.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop wasting money in Research/Development and on Brooke Shields. Start working on employee retention programs. Don’t you get it? If you have to be constantly training new folks all the time, you will have a inexperienced staff that does not know what they are doing. Consider paying good salaries, perhaps great compensation packages or maybe establishing an attractive commission plan. This way you will attract elite salesmen that will sell anything to anyone and generate the type of revenue your expecting with a spokesperson like Brook Shields."La-Z-Boy can survive without Brooke Shields, but it will not survive without a good sales force!"</advice-to-management>

“I only need one word: Exceptional.”

</title><pros>Pros – Everything about this company is just awesome. I've never worked at a more professional and well managed business. The people are great, the pay is more than I expected at this point in my career, and the work itself is fun and challenging enough to keep me interested. The intentions from management seems to be that they want to mold this company into one of the best out there and their efforts really show.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Sometimes communication between departments falls apart, but I think everyone honestly tries to help each other out. The technology used is antiquated and causes problems often enough to be a pain.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Upgrade some of our software and hardware? I dunno. I understand something like that is a big commitment and carries a huge price tag, along with there being no guarantee that the new system would not cause just as many problems.</advice-to-management>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The better you treat your employees the better your sales will be. Motivation is needed to keep the employees interested, but the only people who seem to benefit in this company are the regional managers. Mystery Shops are degrading. Also, the pay given to sales managers is ridiculous. If you break down their salary, it's less than the sales associates.</advice-to-management>

“You never know when it'll be your last day.”

</title><pros>Pros – It's not a cut-throat environment, but still a good old boys culture. Slowly changing with new people coming on board.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Executives continue to receive bonuses despite several severe lay-offs of employees. Cost-saving measures should apply to all levels of employees and bonuses should not be dispensed when the value of the stock and sales continue to decline.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The quality of upholstered products has declined over the years. La-Z-Boy used to have an excellent reputation for products that lasted years, but recent cost savings initiatives have compromised the quality. Developing innovative high-end products (such as electronic recliners) that cost too much won't increase sales in a competitive market.</advice-to-management>

“Horrible management makes for a hellish life.”

</title><pros>Pros – The sofas and recliners are still mostly assembled in the USA and the product generally wears well and La-Z-Boy treats its customers very well.We had a good team of people to work with at my location.They do pay partial medical, vision and dental insurance.Great initially training from the Phoenix base company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You will work every weekend, holidays and most nights, even though in Tucson, Sundays are dead and often nobody even walks in the doors weeknights after 4:30 pm. It doesn't matter that everyone is sitting around with nothing to do and no customers on Sundays, you still have to be there. Cause you know what? You don't get paid by the hour. You are commission only. They'll work you at least 45-50+ hours a week and you better just be thrilled you have a job.  You are supposed to have no life outside of the company. Why should you? The manager doesn't. She works 7 days a week, often open to close.  Lord knows why. She certainly doesn't give any ongoing training or need to be there. We sold more every time she was gone simply because there was no pressure! Little to no positive performance feedback with consistent good performance. If the sales are not happening especially during tough economic times micro-mangement takes over causing a very uneasy and stressful atmosphere. The manager eaves drops on all your conversations with customers and associates and knows exactly where you are and what you and every other sales person is doing at every moment. Unless you smoke, forget taking a moments break even if the store is dead. Then it's time to dust your area, listen to tell you what she watched on TV the evening before,  Forget taking a lunch break. She never does because she anorexic, so why should you? She will come back and harass you about something while you are eating or tell you "There's a customer on the floor! You need to get out here!" Often you jump up only to find it was someone wanting directions or , "oops, that's so and so's customer". And if you leave for lunch, God forbid, you will feel her wrath when you return. Don't be gone for more than 30 minutes or she will work with the customer that should be yours, sell it and give the commission to her favorite. .Commission based salary therefore it's to their advantage to sell as much as they possibly can to earn a good living, however the staff is treated like they have no desire to make any money and are blamed for slow sales. Management makes you feel like you don't want to make money. You are grilled after each and every opportunity, "Why didn't you sell?" "Did you sell fabric protection?" Commission works in companies' favor, not yours. Say your goal is $50,000 this month.  If you make that goal you will make a 7% commission...as long as you jump thru the other hoops. You have to have $10,000 sold to In-Home Design Customer AND $5000 in has to be in Tables, Lamps and Accessory sales, or it drops to 6%. The worst part is that the furniture often isn't ready until the following month or 2 for delivery. This is out of our hands. Say the following month the company gives you an outrageous goal (which goes up every year no matter what the economy is doing!) and you only make it to the 5% commission level but the furniture you sold at 7% is ready for delivery, you guess it, you only get paid 5% after all that hard work. You are paid commission only after delivery, and not the commission you sold it for. Oh! And say the store goal for the month is $300,000 and you are supposed to have 6 sales people to split this between. But the manager fired one and the other left because the job sucks. So now that goal is the same and instead of having to sell $50,000, you now need to sell $75,000 to make it to goal. And then, when you can't, you are put on probation and threatened to be fired if you don't make it to goal 2 out of the next 3 months. And hello! We are the ones doing all the work and the managers and owners are making the big money!!!The ones that are kissing up to customers and working their butts off to sell so you can make so much more money off of us. Sometimes I think CEO's forget who's doing the job for them. It's very hard to know that your CEO is bringing in a HUGE salary every year while their employees are struggling to make ends meet only to have that struggle made harder and harder every year. Favoritism has become a job requirement for managers. Helping only certain employees and covering up for there mistakes, actually doing their job for them. Working with customers on their behalf when they are with other customers...even though you have no customer and could close that sale. and not helping the employees that are juggling customers and doing their job!! Then reprimanding them for not meeting goals. My bottom line comment: treat others how you would like to be treated. I believe that there is going to be a special place in hell for those that made the life of those under them a stress-filled hell on earth experience. My manager changed our schedules often and one day I thought I was supposed to come in at my normal shift time and when I got there I learned I was an hour late. Not that there were any customers in the store or that there wasn't anyone else working...but the manager fired me on the spot.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to the sales people who are working with the public everyday! Believe that they want to sell and make a living.  Trust them. Treat them as you want to be treated. Remember that people are more important than selling a recliner.</advice-to-management>

“Don't.”

</title><pros>Pros – Very good training on sales techniques - or at least, if was so when I started. If you want to get a toehold on a sales career, this is a good place to get paid while learning the basics.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Commissions are some of the worst in the area. Time off is difficult at best. Health care is outrageously expensive. Management seem to relish playing "gotcha", removing half or all of your commission on a sale for trivial errors. Arbitrary monthly sales goals are set without warning and with intense pressure.</cons>

“La-Z-Boy Opportunity! Not”

</title><pros>Pros – Well constructed furniture.  Well respected brand name.  Attractive physical environment.  I like the freedom to work at my own pace and interact with clients.  There is the opportunity to sell tables and accessories as well as sofa's and chairs.  I like the teamwork I have with my other co-workers.  There is no back biting  or stealing in my location.  The company provides 2 weeks training upfront, both on selling and product.  There is ongoing sales training and product training.  We get to go out to the houses of our clients to measure and determine better what they need.  It's an opportunity to sell more product.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low pay.  Minimal holidays and sick days.  Long hours and high health insurance costs.  There are 7 stores in Northeast Ohio owned by the same person(it's a franchise).  It's hard to make a decent income because of the way he has structured the commission system.  Their is a great deal of turnover and alot of unhappy people.  You are expected to work every holiday and several evenings a week.  Some days you are expected to work 9 to 9.  You do not get any sick days for the first year.  The health insurance is pretty high so most employees can't afford it.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Not an exciting or intellectual job.  No benefits, no commission, no advancement (why would you want to?)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Perhaps if you actually went into a store you might understand why sales are down.  For a business that has around for half a century, you would think that they could advertise to people that they sell more than just recliners.  Also, get some chairs that dont look like they are from the 50s.  Seriously, younger generations come in to buy furniture and are horrified by the outdated furniture and fabrics and walk out.  The majority of the sales are to people who around when the company started.  Quit pushing the fabric protection that no one wants.  Quit forcing employees those stupid black folders (you change the name of them every 3 months).  Customers only get pissed when you hound them for their personal information.  One customer actually thought I was asking to draw their living room layout so I could rob them.  Quit having sales every holiday, but only mark down some items.  Mark down all the items, or actually pick something people will want to buy.  Have a computer system in place so customers can see what their chair would look like in a fabric instead of having them hold up a small piece of cloth to furniture.  I could go  on and on and on....</advice-to-management>

“Wants Commission Salespeople but Offers Low Hourly Pay”

</title><pros>Pros – Store Management is approachable and the scheduling is flexible. My coworkers are incredibly friendly and most are decent workers.   If you are interested in pursuing a sales career you can learn a lot here and they do usually promote from within. You can earn extra money in your paycheck by selling certain items.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management wants to hire positive people but forget that a positive attitude often has a trickle down effect. If you don't provide a good example, how do expect others to follow? ThisThe pressure of the job is fairly high as compared with jobs that offer similar pay.  Your sales are tracked, they want a certain Guardsmen(fabric warranty) percentage, and you can be fired if you fail a secret shop or forget to ask for the sale twice. The problem that I have with the last part is that they will fire part timers for that, but yet, Sales Managers can miss their sales goals 3X before they're fired. So, apparently asking for the sale is more important than making sales. On busier days, when you are forced to take on more than one customer it is easy to forget if you have "asked for the sale" or sometimes it is difficult to determine what the secret shopper will consider is "asking for the sale".There is a very high turnover I have had 2 store managers in a year. The store itself has had 6-7 different store managers in 5 years.  The retail ads are confusing and customers often get angry at the unclear advertising, for example, in the fliers it will say recliner $299 when it is only the rocker recliner while the wall hugger and glider cost more.  I honestly can see their point when they say it just says recliner. Also, a recent sale was the Bonus Coupon sale and the prices were already marked with the discount, so, what was the point of having coupons? This was another time customers were confused and salespeople had try to try to quell the aggravation.Some of the employees that I have dealt with in corporate have been out and out rude.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – La-Z-Boy does sell a high quality product and I do believe that La-Z-Boy is basically a good company that has lost its way. I wish that there was more positive reinforcement, in fact, I would have liked to see something like the Lazingo created for the secret shop maybe stores could get bonuses for getting 100% and if they get so many in a row they get a hire bonus. I really don't see a lot of positive attitudes from upper management and very little (if any) praise even if sales goals are being met.I also believe that if you increased the hourly pay for salespeople or offered some benefits after a period of time, then, you would get a more loyal salespeople.  Even from when I started, the company has made some pretty big changes both good and bad.  There are many benefits to having an hourly sales staff but if you want to choose from a better pool or want people to stay longer than a year or so...it would be beneficial to offer something more competitive.</advice-to-management>

“Little Furniture Store with Big Potential”

</title><pros>Pros – La-Z-Boy offers a terrific product at an upper-end price.  The stores have potential to be solid performers, but are 1-2 years from reaching that level.  Overall, a good atmosphere.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's retail, so you'll work every weekend and holiday.  The part-time staff is difficult to motivate and even more difficult to retail @ $8.50 p/h.  No room for advancement from a store manager's position.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The marketing department is certainly letting the retail division down.  While consumer confidence is rising, your traffic is decreasing.</advice-to-management>

“Great Company”

</title><pros>Pros – -Great people to work with-Flexibility-Some really great customers to deal with-Overall, it is a great working environment</pros>
<cons>Cons – The only con that I would say they have is that they do not offer health benefits to part-time employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I think that you should start offering health benefits to part-time employees at a discount.  Private insurance is very expensive compared to group rates.</advice-to-management>
