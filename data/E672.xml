“I enjoyed working at Toys R Us very much.”

</title><pros>Pros – Upper management support, let me run my Departments & Supervisors the way I thought was best. Gave me time to coach my team.Salary, vacation time, and personal days.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Labor hours - not enough. Very high number of call outs because most team members were part-time, this hurt my weekend coverage. Did not hold them accountable for call outs.I averaged 60 hours a week.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hire more mature Team Members, Share corporate news. Just over the last 6 months to a year at least 4 District Managers left the company. My wife and I have been working for Toys for the last 6 years. We decided that I would resign and change my retail career.</advice-to-management>

“It's retail.”

</title><pros>Pros – Management works with you to grow you in the company. They help you with scheduling. Almost always great people to work with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It always felt management past the store managers are out of touch with what is going on in the store. The district manager would tell your team to do one thing and then another big wig would come in and say that's wrong do it this way. Also working at a toy store during the holiday season can be brutal. Also if you wanted to move up in the company you have to be willing to relocate to another store. You can get promoted from part-time to a full-time supervisor IF someone from the DS team steps up to a ASM position at another store.</cons>

“High School and College Job”

</title><pros>Pros – - Flexible schedule around school, family vacations, and other activities.- Overnights during the holiday season were usually fun; working during days was hit and miss depending on customer attitudes.- Useful life experience to have been at the bottom of the totem pole in employment.- Job was straightforward and didn't require any thought while not there.- Watching parent/kid interactions was occasionally funny/entertaining and will be potentially useful when having kids.- Many days (unloading the truck/working out product/carrying out big ticket items) could be good exercise.- Generally likeable co-workers throughout my time there.</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Pay-level flirting with minimum wage.- Occasionally customers or (only one in my case) manager(s) could really dampen one's day.- When working register, long list of questions to cover though most people aren't interested.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – - Big one to corporate: when redoing the store layout (twice a year), make it not physically impossible to match the specified layout (due to configuration of the store, etc.) which made it frustrating for everyone on the in-store end.- Also to corporate: don't continuously send new products with no intended place in the store (again making it frustrating to place them).- Keep up the good work at the store-level management in St. Cloud, MN.</advice-to-management>

“Looks great on a resume but it's a mess from the inside. It's existing on fumes.”

</title><pros>Pros – Generally speaking, I worked with a very nice group of people across the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Departments are treated inconsistently to each other. If eCommerce has a good year, they get a holiday party. Anyone else? A potluck breakfast. Also, this is NOT a family friendly company, sadly enough. At least in my department, there was NO working from home whatsoever. It was not allowed.</cons>

“Lackluster leadership”

</title><pros>Pros – Toys R Us Brand - great memories of going to toys store.Tenured staff (double edge sword)Might be better off as a consultant there instead of staffLots of product trainingCan move to different departments</pros>
<cons>Cons – frequent layoffs - and I'm not talking about seasonal staffTenured staff not as open to new ideasTeam is a core value- I haven't found that the culture lives up to that except on Thanksgiving  when corporate staff can choose to work in the stores or their annual christmas event for children.Benefits are not the greatest - but recognize that benefits are changing at a lot of companiesTraining- feast or famine depending on your level.Trying to move up- not a lot of programs for that- no mentoring or training (feast or famine)</cons>

“Good people. Terrible Management”

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible schedule, friendly and helpful coworkers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Terrible managers, awful (limited) training, low pay and hardly room for advancement. Hard to stand out and difficult to have a passion for the job when most managers don't know how to motivate employees, all they care about is sales of warranties and memberships. Most training and product knowledge you'll have to learn by yourself as you go along,</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Take time to choose the right managers and to train them properly. No one wants to work in a place where no matter how hard you work, most managers point out flaws repeatedly in front of other employees and guests and compare two employees by glorifying one and humiliating the other while out in public. A manager's job isn't to only point out your mistakes, but to motivate you to do so much better and learn from them.</advice-to-management>

“would not recommend, no matter HOW desperate you are for a job.”

</title><pros>Pros – -I had more positive experiences with customers then the people I worked with.-Though a few of the co-workers were nice. Emphasis on "a few".-I got paid. That's always a good thing.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The manager at the time was TERRIBLE. He ignored people's request to take days off. He slacked. He was rude/in a bad mood majority of the time. Same for the co-manager. The supervisor I had to work with half the time was even worse. To this day I wonder how any of them got a job working in TRU.The store I worked in is the biggest in the district, yet we somehow had the least amount of workers. And this DID NOT help during the holiday season. For two weeks before Christmas, I had to answer phone calls and that's it. Sounds great, right? Sitting around...answering phone calls...munching on candy that was in the computer room...Wrong. Workers on the floor had to look up the items for me, but nobody would. The manager (unsurprisingly) didn't care, thus I was forced to run around checking inventory AND answer the countless phone calls.Another problem I had was the fact that the supervisors and managers failed to tell others if they did something wrong. I know I screwed up a few times, but other than that I thought was doing fine for a few months until randomly one day a supervisor told me that there were complaints about me. I'm not sure how they expected the workers to improve if they never tell them anything. I don't know if they thought I was mind reader, but if I was one, then I sure as hell wouldn't've worked there."Training" to be a cashier was an absolute joke, as was the training in general. The coupons they have are a joke, and most of the time you'll find yourself having trouble with them, as with any sale they have going on.The company expects you to basically nag the junk out of customers about buying batteries and getting their reward cards and credit cards. They expect you ask at least 4 different questions each time someone buys something, even if they're just buying some candy.There's A LOT of ass kissing you have to do in order to get any recognition. The most awful workers got a lot of recognition and respect from the higher-ups. Speaking of respect, there was none to give to us cashiers and item-shelf-straighteners, none whatsoever. Oh, but the slacker-of-a-supervisor who took 4 smoke breaks in a span of 3 hours and was no where to be found half the time? All the respect for that guy.Now, it appears that some people have had awesome experiences working for this (god forbidden) company, but I will say this: if you want to work here, it's going to be very hit-or-miss.Oh, and did I mention how you only get 10% off of your purchases as a TRU member? And how you can't use that on a few things? Ridiculous, I know.</cons>

“Misled”

</title><pros>Pros – 10% off discount almost all items.</pros>
<cons>Cons – 1800 support staff, upper management hires & practices.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There is no reason to seek participation from employees to answer questions regarding store-level operations, morale, etc. if no action is seen from corporate when a store's survey results in percentages below 70% on questions relating to store management being fair, etc.Tech support should provide long term solutions to equipment issues - not short term solutions that end up costing the company more when such equipment becomes damaged beyond repair.Also, the company could save a lot of money if they knew how much money is wasted at store level on paper alone. Corporate would be amazed.Corporate space analysts/planogram creators should be held more accountable if the planograms they create do not reflect a store's layout. There were numerous planograms that displayed measurements for gondolas, end caps, etc. that were inaccurate.Stores should have a greater say in informing corporate buyers that certain buying decisions of products (ex: high school musical merchandise) does not sell, even in clearance or manager markdown situations.All stores should be more conscientious toward physically impaired individuals. Numerous guests complained over the lack of at least a wheelchair.Corporate should also take more interest in making unannounced visits to stores, without the presence of a DM, SM, and/or ASM, to learn more about how much financial waste occurs.</advice-to-management>

“Ok place to work, needs a lot of improvement.”

</title><pros>Pros – People at my specific store were great, it was a lot of fun, and availability could be flexible and management would work around school.</pros>
<cons>Cons – hours are very limited unless you are full time.   Promotions are VERY hard to come by, and if they appear there is a lot of favoritism. and the pay sucks! starting is minimum wage (8$ in CA)  There's too much expected from associates with anyone above supervisor doing the bare minimum.   Management really needs to improve, about 10 people have left within 6 months. Considering we are a store with about 30 or so associates, that is a big chunk.   Also work is distributed unevenly within associates, with a hand full of people responsible for the work of the team.   I knew people who worked at surrounding stores within the Bay Area in CA, and some of the same problems of lack of communication, and work unbalance were common.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – The more you can perform, the more you'll get paid, which seems fair on the surface.</pros>
<cons>Cons – With getting paid more, it comes with strenuous work loads. Someone calls out, you very well may be doing their job and yours.Minimization of staff, due to payroll, which seems to be a problem at most Toys R Us branches.Employees aren't properly trained to work in areas of the store that produce the most sales. No is trained to show customers how strollers and car seats function, putting employees in a tough spot, and leaving the customer frustrated. Cashiers working around the store's electronics mostly only know how to ring up purchases, and half the time, not knowledgeable about the actual products in the area.</cons>

<cons>Cons – where to begin... first off here was horrible management. they were absolutely pitiful. let me mention that I had worked in another TRU in a different state & loved it!!. I Re-located to Wichita Kansas and it went down the drain. I got 8 hours the first week and 6.5 the next , then no hours the next, and the I got called in to come for an hour and a half. the store is dirty and employees are lazy. newbies are expected to carry the weight of an incompetent staff and poor mangers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Do not hire somebody promising them their previous wage and at least 20 hours, only to deliver less than 10 hours a week and minimum wage.</advice-to-management>

“Overall great experience.”

</title><pros>Pros – Firstly I must say that if you are considering or have just accepted a position from TRU as your first job, don't stress out. I can honestly say that this is the easiest job I've ever had. I met so many great people there. You will receive great hours from about July to December. The supervisors and management help out with any customer situation or question you may have, and they really like it when you show them that you have an interest in expanding your in-store knowledge and skill set.</pros>
<cons>Cons – From January to June, the store is almost dead. I would actually get 4 hours a week consecutively, and for way too long. The hours are horrible for everyone though, even management. This is impossible to live off of if you have bills to pay. However, it is a great time to take time off if you really needed to. I was encouraged to at this time to go see out of state family, because it distributes the hours a little bit better. One thing that was complained about by nearly everyone, is that they will hire just about anyone who applies for season. No matter how sloppy and rude they were, and majority of them were not much help with anything. The assistant manager my store hired seasonally was essentially a horrible dictator.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – There are great people to work with and for. Most of the customers are pleasant and looking for a good time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is no exit strategy for obsolete merchandise. Ever. Management turnovers can be outstandingly high. Some people in stores have no work ethic.</cons>

“Try to avoid being a cashier”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a job so it is better than nothing.  You are told by management to approach every guest and talk to people so that can be a pro or a con depending on your personality.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You are constantly nagged by management to get customers to sign up for loyalty cards and credit cards and are never praised for selling.I started at 8.50 an hour and minimum wage is 8.00 and the annual raise is only around 20 to 30 cents a year.  The hours are usually a con because you will always be scheduled on Saturdays unless you are a full time employee.  Full time employees usually get what I considered to be the best shifts: weekday mornings and Sundays.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Hired with the promise of being promoted within 3 months. I learned much later that is what they tell everyone.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Horrible Store Managers horrible District Management unless you are part of the good old boys club. Yes it still exists at this company. If you are not one of the 'chosen' your requests for vacation time that you have earned and specific days off will be ignored. You will be scheduled to close and then back to open while Store Manager takes extra time away from the store to enjoy life. But be sure you get all the resets and price changes done with no staff. The SM will schedule all the strong workers on his shift and then ask what your problem is that you can't service the guest & complete all the tasks.</cons>

“Awesome, although your mileage may vary.”

</title><pros>Pros – I worked at a "pop-up" store, which meant things were small, close-knit, and lacked a lot of the bureaucracy and oversight you might find at other stores. We handled business and had a blast. I had very down to earth, and trusting managers, as well as very cool co-workers. The environment lent itself to more of a family atmosphere, and that made the job infinitely better.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Pop-up stores sometimes don't last, and such was the case with us. Other than that, there weren't any other cons, and it was easily the best job I've had, as far as retail and slave wages go.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Try to understand that ruling with an iron fist won't get you the results you need. Be close enough until you understand how people work, and then reap the benefits from a workforce that is comfortable in their own skin and willing do the work for you as you need.</advice-to-management>

“Great people to work with, no so great company to work for.”

</title><pros>Pros – The employees were really good to work with and we all mostly did our best to help each other around the store as it was needed. I enjoyed working with customers as well, since most that came into the store outside of the Christmas season were regulars. The job itself wasn't physically demanding outside of working trucks. My management team was friendly and got along with almost everyone on the job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Despite not being a physically demanding job, corporate tends to cut corners and cut hours to a bare minimum for different projects. They also expect an individuals to take on lots of responsibilities without offering acceptable pay raises or other incentives to strive at the job. I left due to pay and the stress from Christmas season.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Pay the employees higher than minimum wage and give decent pay raises. One of the difficulties with paying so low is you get people who don't care about the job. When the pay rises, people start to care more, or you will pull in better employees for your business. Better employees means better customer service and you will receive fewer complaints on bad employees.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – -Several backstabbing employees and managers.-Gossiping and rumors going around daily, which can make work distracting.-Management promotes some questionable people who seem to have been favored from day one and lets go of some talented people for no good reason.-Store discount of only 10%.-Workload constantly increases and firedrills happen almost daily.-Analysts are forcefully encouraged to take on projects that add to the almost impossible workload, otherwise they are looked down upon or not considered for promotion..-Some managers are extremely demanding and unreasonable and will throw you under the bus if they feel threatened by their analysts' performance.-Contradicting performance reviews.-Widespread layoffs after unfavorable annual results are reported.-Very high turnover rate for analysts, hence the training program twice a year with new hires.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Make sure candidates who are being promoted to management are equipped with the proper people skills before promotion.  Although many of the planning managers are really great people with good management skills, there are more than a handful who drive out their analysts with improper and unprofessional treatment.  Also, stop laying off large groups of employees every year.  Find other ways to cut costs and produce more favorable sales results through innovation; letting go of good employees is not the answer.</advice-to-management>

“One great supervisor and two lousy supervisors.”

</title><pros>Pros – I liked most of my co workers but we were all over worked with very long hours and no overtime pay. At least we could all commiserate on how miserable we were. If that can be considered a Pro? I do not miss the job at all.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No one understood how difficult the workload was that they piled on to the managers. It was expected that workers would get the job done even if it meant staying until midnight and working weekends which I did plenty of. Over the years our benefits were chiseled away so that by the time I left, the medical insurance I am buying myself at present is better coverage than what the company provided.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please just say thank you for a change for a job well done instead of working against the people who are there trying to do a great job and under appreciated.</advice-to-management>

“Not Horiffying”

</title><pros>Pros – Most Co-workers are really friendly and nice and helpful. The kids are all cute, it's great to put a smile on their faces.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They push metrics way too much. Managers practically shove it down your throat about metrics. You get a talking to every time you don't meet your goals. They also don't train new people enough. They get a few hours to learn basics and that's it.  And recovery sucks. Hire some people to go put re-shop away during store hours instead of having to stay an hour after closing.</cons>

“Regular store is not that great of a place, but the Express store makes me not regret my decision!”

</title><pros>Pros – The only pros I have are for the Express store. It's a small, fun environment. Co-workers are nice and will help you if you need it!</pros>
<cons>Cons – The regular TRU/BRU store is awful. Hardly any training whatsoever. I trained on the cash register for a couple of hours and that was it. When facing something I didn't know how to do, coworkers/managers did it for me rather than show me. I had to ask SO many questions because no one ever bothered to train me properly.</cons>

“Legalized Indentured Servitude”

</title><pros>Pros – ..... thinking ......... none come to mind.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The amount Corporate expects out of one person is INSANE. The constant resets and phase changes - basically reinventing the wheel every couple weeks - is demoralizing and exhausting.  The pay rate is minimal at best. They need to seriously re-evaluate the work load expected and the amount they pay. And if you get a bad set of Managers? - look out - you are totally screwed.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management / Corporate needs to get out on the floor and experience who their decisions effect the Associates. I always found it interesting that we were required to work holidays but when we would call the Corp offices, we were told the offices were closed so they could enjoy the holidays with their families. Apparently, the average Associate didn't desire to do the same thing. Oh yeah - no extra pay for working a holiday either.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible schedule, people are great to work with, always something new to learn</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not enough hours given.  lots of times you are understaffed.  Once they do not like you, it becomes a witch hunt, looking at you with a magnifying glass.  I have seen this often.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You need to either give more hours, which I believe would pay for itself due to less theft, or cut back on what is expected. It is difficult for the supervisors and extremely hard for the assistant managers.  Near impossible.</advice-to-management>

“Good place to start of and gain some experience.Team members”

</title><pros>Pros – Team members, supervisors, and managers are super layback and friendly. A good job to acquire as your first job. Lays down the basics for what any entry level job without any sort of degree will be like.</pros>
<cons>Cons – In my situation I received little to no training, hours are ridiculous, and you're constantly doing things that are no where on your job description. There is also little to no room for improvement in terms of gaining a higher position in the company.</cons>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I already have....no open door policy here. Everyone is out for themselves. Wish I could give zero stars as that's what this organization now deserves.  Get people at your beloved "RHQ" that actually care.</advice-to-management>

“Ever wonder why new hires quit jobs so quickly?”

</title><pros>Pros – Associates are nice, and everyone seems to work towards a common goal.  Somewhat competetive pay for the area and type of job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Complete lack of training and communication.  Had two hours with another associate on register, then left on my own.  Was hired for one position, my first day discovered I was going to be in another position (one I would not have accepted) with no discussion with me.  Upper managers will explain some things in minute detail, while glossing over other things (usually the things I've never done before.)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Invest in training associates and new management from the get go, rather than dumping them on their own to figure stuff out.  Nothing leads to frustration and dissatisfaction with a new job more quickly than being dump on the floor with zero direction or instruction.</advice-to-management>

“Had no clue what i was getting myself into.”

</title><pros>Pros – Getting to talk to the kids about what toys they wanted was always a lot of fun. And some of the employees are very hard workers which makes work go by a lot easier and faster.They also start you off at 7.80/hour instead of 7.40/hour.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The managers are horrible. The rudest people you'll ever meet. You never get trained and nobody really about that anyway. They give you a walkie talkie and ask you to use it if you need any help. To make things worse, after the store closes at 9p.m. they make you stay in the store until 4a.m. cleaning up after the customers and kids that wrecked everything. You can't leave until the store is spotless or you'll get fired. One of the managers would even go to the different toy aisles, knock everything off of the shelves, and make us redo the whole aisle. It was awful.</cons>

“Wonderful Place To Work.... During the Holidays”

</title><pros>Pros – Working here was great during Oct-Jan. There is a rush of overwhelming excitement from the holiday season and you are working a lot. The shifts feel shorter and you get to talk to customers and help them make decisions that can potentially impact a child's holiday.Management always helps out and are understanding about mistakes. They will transfer you to other stores if the need arises and there are many chances to be promoted.</pros>
<cons>Cons – After the first few weeks of January, business is dead. Suddenly your shift feels like it is 10x longer than it was before and you stand around waiting and hoping for the moment when a customer will come and look at something. It can get pretty disheartening.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – Friendly people, Nice atmosphere, easy, help generally given.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Unreasonable time frame to do projects (example: a 60 minute project is given 5 minutes to complete)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Give enough time to the person asking for it. If the person is a goof off then no, I understand that, but most of the time the veterans who know what they are doing are usually brushed off. I do not know if The highest levels give the proper time and the District Manager gives less hours in order to get a bigger bonus. That is an easy fix..No bonus' all around. There is not enough time in the day to do everything this is true, but my big suggestion is to think about this. If you force stores to cut hours and the floor people go home leaving the floor open for shrink you are not helping your business.  It seems you put less people on the floor to save money, but at the same time Shrink goes up, way up. Lat year my store had an ungodly amount of shrink, but it all could have been avoided by a second person on RGD and proper people in the correct zones. Plus the aisles will look better and have the opportunity to sell more merchandise having it correctly merchandised. Also you need more Department Supervisors to help with the load. It will help and I guarantee more money for the business.</advice-to-management>

“I WANTED a career with your company but that's IMPOSSIBLE!”

</title><pros>Pros – Worked at the Babies R Us store for a few years and that was excellent. The customers were terrific and the management was well trained.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Toys R Us store is a complete 180 from the Babies R Us. Training stinks. There is no time for anything. There are 2 employees and one manager for the most part of the day. No hours are given unless you are a supervisor. If you are a supervisor you MUST have completely open availability which means, they can schedule you til 4am during season and then come back in at 8am the next day.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Allow your employees to be able to balance home life as well as work. Perhaps allow your supervisors to pick one day a week where they have off or even one day a week where they know their hours!!! You make it IMPOSSIBLE for a single parent of 2 to have a career with your company.</advice-to-management>

“Employees treated badly”

</title><pros>Pros – Some team members have become like family. At the same time others are very clicky. Though I love working with e pec rant moms and families.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I work at Babies R Us side. Very gossipy. People will talk about others making up stories to help themselves.Management will write up a team member to save their own ass.Regarding customer issues management never has your back, you are on your own fighting for your rights. HR will also gossip to management when you try to confide in them. Don't ever get hurt working for this company either, you will stay injured and fight in court, and stay injured indefinitely. They will change your hours or position at the drop of a hat. There is NO holiday pay or extra benefit for working holidays.  For a family oriented company they could care less about family except their own. I went from hired as full time to the company pushing it to part time then went from 30-33 hrs a week to being lucky if there were 10. Managers will lie  and blame others for their mistakes or a problem that they caused. They promise promotions and then bring in who they want, or not even let the inside person apply for the promotion. They stay open during state of emergencies and give you hell for calling out. Don't ever try to leave early either.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Upper management needs to not only look at the mighty buck. This company is going down the tubes because you are not running the company competently. If you give to your employees you will get more all the way through. We work our tails off for a company that could care less about us!!</advice-to-management>

“If you put your family first then this is not the job for you.”

</title><pros>Pros – Seeing the expecting moms and dads buy stuff for their babies. Helping customers pick out baby shower gifts, etc. The Babies R Us I worked at was in a mall so it was a great diversity of people. Customers were generally very kind and understanding.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Training is on the computer for 3 days and only about 30 minutes on the sales floor. After that you're thrown out into this huge store to fend for yourself. Spent 45 minutes with one customer trying to find an item on her registry print out. No one else helped me. Also, when I had a scheduling issue and tried to explain it to my GM, he cut me off mid sentence and said he "didn't care about my personal life" and was only concerned with "the hours I said I was available to work when he hired me". I was so disgusted with him I no call no showed and then quit. Didnt even last a month.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Train your employees more on products and the store. Most of the training was signing policy after policy and watching your "R US" robots on a computer screen stress how much you "care about your employees" (what a joke!) It doesn't matter how new your employees are you should value them ALL!</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – The company as a whole knows how to make you feel unappreciated. Certain Mgr's will decrease your hours if you ask for a change in schedule (weeks or months in advance). The raises are once a year only. The max is .25. The management "tree" is a little iffy as to who is your boss. They rarely promote from within, and once promoted they offer you very low pay.</cons>

<cons>Cons – I've been out of this job for 3 months now, and I still can't think of anything that was good about that job. There are never enough hours to efficiently run a store of that size, leading all the supervisors to be overworked and admonished by management when everything could not be done all at once. There are just unreasonable expectations for the amount of work to get done by the amount of people that are able to do it.</cons>

<cons>Cons – All this company cares about is metrics. The philosphoy is "change the people or change the people" - I have never felt so underappreciated in my life. If you do well with personal metrics, they want to to get more numbers so they threaten you with hours. If you aren't doing well, they take away your hours instead of giving training or coaching to improve. Hours fluctuate - some weeks you get 5 hours, other weeks you'll get 30 (when it's convenient for them, of course). Minimum wage to start, with the opportunity for yearly reviews, where you get at most a 25 cent raise.</cons>

How often store management is asked to perform at unbelieveable levels with very few workers and even fewer hours to work out projects by corporate level management.

“Toys "R" Us is stressful during season and very relaxed otherwise; but, all in all an easy side job.”

</title><pros>Pros – Employees are down-to-earth and considerate.  Knowledge of sales and deals at Toys "R" Us is a perk.  Store Manager is friendly and flexible with schedules.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Store tends to get very dirty and inventory is often strewn about.  Managers constantly berate employees about metrics.  Out-of-season is very limited in terms of work hours given to part-time employees.  Employee discount is negligible.  Training is very informal and lacking.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Improve inventory by allowing customers to have official input on what they want to purchase.  Improve the "Big Ticket" request system because as it is now, customers take a slip, wait in line at registers, hand the slip, cashiers call Big Ticket, and customers have to wait even longer before exiting the store and/or making the purchase.  Streamline the Big Ticket system so that customers can make the request before ever standing in line at registers.  Improve break rooms.  Rest rooms also need lots of attention.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Management is very flexible. If you give them a heads up they are willing to help with any off time you need or shift switches. People they tend to hire often mesh well with others. I didn't have a negative thing to say about my co-workers.</pros>

“Corporate Human Resources not a good place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – I had  nice and friendly co-workers.  It was a good place to jog/walk.  Small but good gym and very affordable dry cleaner available to employees.  Half days on Fridays during the summer if you made up the time.  Cafeteria on premises.   Starbucks coffee.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Corporate Human Resources was a good place to work.  Belligerent management destroyed the warm, friendly culture former and better managment spent years cultivating.  It is now a toxic environment without respect, motivation, or career development.  Co-workers just disappear one day and you found out much later they were let go, without any explanation from management.  Poor leadership.  Morale is nonexistent. What a shame because it used to be a really great and fun place to work.</cons>

“not so great but 8.5 is higher than minimum wage”

</title><pros>Pros – 10% discount  on toys and baby products</pros>
<cons>Cons – Busy season don't expect a break.  They work you right through your paid 15 minute breaks, and most of your unpaid 1/2 hour breaks.  Yes there's little notes in the break room telling you to call the toll free number if you feel like you're not getting your fair share of breaks... don't call it unless you want to be fired for some other reason.  After they work you through your 1/2 break (unpaid) they ask you to sign a piece of paper saying you forgot to punch in and out for lunch.  Then there's the buyer protection plans (look at the prices of the protection plan... you're paying too much according to the manufacturers).  You are expected to shove these down the throats of the customers.   You don't sell enough in a day, you get publicly humiliated in the break room they put big fat zeros next to your name for all your co-workers to see.Lot's and Lot's of young management on power trips.  Much like being in Jr. High again.  If you're  not in the in crowd expect 20 hours a week spread out so that it's impossible to work another job, expect to close one night and open the following morning, and expect to work every single weekend.  Everyone who works for toys r us are expected to know how to run the cash registers.... it doesn't work like that.  If you're in the in crowd, you don't have to work the cash register if you don't want to.</cons>

“R Zone”

</title><pros>Pros – The work is very easy. Outside of season you really don't due much. It's a good job for students.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Almost everything. The stores really push Rewards, and Credit Cards a lot. A majority of customers already have the Rewards cards, so it's hard to get them. You hours (in R Zone) are based of your metrics. Batteries, Rewards, Buyer Protection Plans, and Instant Credit. My location (like most) are very under staffed. I stand around for half my shift doing nothing because I have to stay visible. I'll be the only person on the floor till I go home. I can't even straightin the area up. It's kinda stressful at times. The management expects a lot, for no real incentive outside pizza parties. I still need training for store policy. But they can't do that due to the lack of hours. I get about 22 hours a week if I'm lucky. I wouldn't want anybody to have this Job unless they have mad sales skills.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – It's a job, hire a lot of people, quite a few of the workers are nice, the interview is a lot of fun, there's a few discounts, easy job to do.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They don't care about their employees, can't use employee discount on diapers or much needed baby supplies, easy to get in trouble at the company, they push stupid questions and a lot of them (at least 6 per person and you have to ask each person if they need batteries, if they have a toy that requires them or not), no tolerance for the workers, very low pay.

“its ok. i dont want to be here here forever though if i cant move up soon”

</title><pros>Pros – good pay, good hours if you ask to work and learn things. and of course if you do a good job then you will make more money. it can be fun at times. talking to people on the sales floor definitely gives great experience for many other future jobs. its not easy to get fired really. not as many crying babies as one might expect. and pregnant ladies are actually pretty kind. when people do recognize your hard work, it feels pretty good, but thats not often. pos system is pretty simple. scheduling is pretty good.</pros>
<cons>Cons – sales pressure for cashiers is not cool. cashiering can make one feel robotic and while it may look good on applications to cashier for a couple years, it does a lot more for your character to sell things on the sales floor. some employees can be rude and immature at times. inconsistent policies and procedures. not all employees are on the same page about how things work. i have a bad feeling that my last pay "raise" was based on a personal bias of one supervisor towards me which had no reasonable explanation to it. its not that easy to be recognized. nobody seems to trust each other. theres no drug tests. after my long time working very hard i feel like if im not recognized as the next supervisor of my department then im basically wasting my time. when the store is busy, the lack of enough main cashiers calls for sales floor workers to get on registers and lose time that could be used on more important tasks. oh, and managers definitely have favorites. too much complaining from everyone about everything. the complaining has definitely rubbed off on me as well</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – pay closer attention to all employees. show more respect. an old assistant manager of mine was basically an expert of the whole store, all managers should be that way. managers should basically know more than anyone when it comes to certain procedures, product knowledge, and just how to do everything. could be a little more open minded. store seems too divided by departments. we need more to make our small group of employees feel like an awesome team. more employees and more business to make use of new employees. if theres any way to suggest to corporate better marketing strategies to improve sales that would be great. out store seems like the minimum of a "busy store".</advice-to-management>

“Very good job but not career unless you like retail A LOT”

</title><pros>Pros – I loved working there for about 8 or 9 months but I was there for 14 months total. I was hired for season in November and it was my first job and I was ecstatic at the age of 17. Working season for the first time was a lot of fun yet a lot of work which wasnt anything to complain about. My managers seemed to love me and I was given a very very very small raise which again i was fine with at 17. I got along great with my coworkers at work but since i was so young i was excluded from most of the activities that the other coworkers always did such as bowling, movies, and bars which i couldnt go for obvious reasons. The pay was ok for me since i was in high school but it was not much. I worked for 14 months and ony made 4500 total.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Aside from the good things,which i cant deny there were a lot but very seldom, there were so many flaws that i never saw until i matured through my job and personal life. One of the biggest flaws is those stupid metrics such as loyalty goals and bpp's and batteries. NOBODY CARES I GUARANTEE IT. of course there are the few suckers (guests) that get sucked into the monopoloy of over priced toys that are "only at toys r us." but in reality and for the real people of this wold, no one cares about loyalty cards and they especially dont care about the secret marketing idea that is behind them. and if metrics ae so important than why shouldnt you give the cashiers some form of comission for selling them. if we dont get any reward for doing them and geting a lot of metrics (and believe me i got plenty) then that causes people like me to not care about metrics. there is no room for advanceent unless you are tere for fricken ever. since there is no room for advancement there is no desire to do anything at all that benefits the ompany unless it somehow benefits us but it DOES NOT. for example wheni had been there for about 4 months they tld me that they wanted to move me to rzone in about two months. im a geek so i belong there and i completed their training but waited patiently for about 6 or 7 months. when they started hiring for season i asked f i could go to rzone but they told me some crappy stuff about me being the best cahier and they needed me to help te new ones. instead of moving me there they hired new people who knew almost nothing and that angered me. cashiering is not hard at all and i figured it out onmy own. they can too. i again patiently wated until season was over and i expected to work rzone by then but no they moved somebody else over there because "it as a girl" . by season after working there for a year with no appreciation i stopped caring at all. during reshop i would stick a bunch of random items behind biger suff so we could leave early. anybody that has worked cashier know its exrremely easy but it is beyondboring and annoying as hell. i got tired of neglect and getting terible hours for terrible wges and constantly working cashier shifts so i just stopped going and could care less what happened because of my absence.sory for all the grammar errors this was off of a phone.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Many older people work at Toys "R" Us and they have been there for years which is indicative that the company is slow to promoteMuch time is spent at the front end of the store as a cashier if store is under-staffedLeadership dismisses internship assignments unless intern is persistent</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – An internship is intended for students to gain a first-hand glimpse into the reality of their chosen job fields. Being a management internship, this is designed for students to understand the various supervisory roles within the organization. In order for an intern to truly learn all of the aspects of their internship, management should be proactive and organized with a plan of action for the week. Interns should not come in and operate as cashiers and/or floor team members. The internship is designed for students who can take on a leadership role as they have already proven the basic skills.</advice-to-management>

“Good people mostly, ridiculous protocol and Yes man managers”

</title><pros>Pros – Good people, if you are full time or if you are working you will at least get hours and if you have a second job then you can get by on the minimal hours , don't know the next week schedule until the day before the next week begins . And the scheduled get revised and not always told of change.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Horrible managing , When you follow through  protocol upper management comes and make you look silly by changing protocol for the customer making you look Ike you don't know what you are doing but when ask them before finalizing decision you get the " you know the rules". Company is a joke</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop using favoritism and leave equal as equal as well stop hiring more and more people and just give more hours to the people who work for you instead of giving four hour shift  and 2 day work weeks</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Company is very HR-centric. This makes it extremely employee friendly, but difficult to hold team member accountable for poor performance.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Low pay. As the big box retail environmental gets more competitive, Toys R Us is stretching the employees very, very thin. Trying to move at a very fast pace, and leaving most of the employees behind in the process.</cons>

“From a temp hire”

</title><pros>Pros – Working with the kids is great, being surrounded by the fun toy atmosphere.  Relatively easy job and great for people who lack job experience and need to build up a resume, and the hours can be flexible if you make sure to bring it up with the manager. Apparently easy to move into a supervisor position.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Understaffed, messy as hell at the store I'm in. Lack of clear duties.  Sporadic scheduling. Can't openly have a beverage out to stay hydrated. Unpaid lunch, flawed timecard system (whoops I accidentally scanned my card twice now I won't get paid for those hours unless I bring it up with a supervisor). Employees seem to be retained only by how many member cards and such that they can hand out.</cons>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – On my first day, before I even had an employee number or even knew how to clock in, I was put at a register with no training or supervision. I didn't even know what buttons to push. This in turn made customers very upset and impatient. There has to be at least some training within the organization. When I asked other associates to help, they seemed just as confused as me. I worked at Toys R Us for one day (I was even asked my the manager there to stay 2 hours extra) and called HR the next day to tell them this was not a good fit.</advice-to-management>

“Low pay, long hours, disregard for rights”

</title><pros>Pros – You get paid money, which is used for buying things.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Breaks are only given because they have to be- you can be standing over 10 hours before you get even a 15 minute break. Especially during the holiday season. Most managers won't let you use the bathroom or get a drink of water even after  hours straight, leaving the majority of employees dehydrated with medical problems not covered because they do not offer benefits. Complaints about harassment are not taken seriously. You work until the store is clean at night, even if it means you stay until 3am or you lose your job. This goes for people with kids, pregnant people, those with second jobs because TRU will not pay a livable wage in any version of reality, etc. You are held to extremely high standards and ridiculous expectations with no option for bonus. This is why most employees do not care about their job and it's reflected in the service customers get from standard red shirts.</cons>

“Excessive management turnover”

</title><pros>Pros – 10% discount on many but not all items in the store.  Salary was very competitive.</pros>
<cons>Cons – In my store we went through 3 district managers, 3 store managers, 1 interim store manager in the span of 3 years.This high turnover resulted in assistant managers having to compete with each other for resources, since there was no real leadership, it broke down cooperation, increased squabbling and finger-pointing.Even when there was stable district leadership, the hours were pretty brutal.  You can expect a 55 to 60 hour work week in a store where things are running well out of season.  70 hours or more and 6 days a week in a situation where the store is not running well, and during the holiday/ inventory season.All of this would have been bearable for those with a strong work ethic, but for one VERY important issue: Respect.When store managers take credit for all the accomplishments you and you peers as ASMs have cultivated through hard work and ridiculous hours, but then get thrown under the bus and have any issues or problems attributed to the ASMs lack of dedication, or ability or care...  It's incredibly demoralizing.  It makes going to work each day a chore.  Worse than that, it sets a precedent where ASMs begin blaming team leads for failures and so on.Everyone in that building is there to succeed.  Of all the district and store leaders in those three years only ONE made the team feel that way.  Everyone else made it clear that the team was there to make them, meaning that one DM or store manager, succeed.  Our personal views, issues, aspirations, needs, challenges did not matter it they did not further his personal growth.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Absolutely ALL of this stems from insufficient training and payroll.  TRU wants to emulate Target so badly, but doesn't take into account that their employee base and your are EXACTLY the same.  Rather than luck out and find a competent manager or hourly team member, how about creating them?Investing in training pays off in too many ways to list here, not the least of which are competence, loyalty and morale.  Do you really think that some eLearing and LMS courses are enough to train someone?  New hires are coverage almost immediately due to payroll constraints.  New managers are thrown in the fray of things immediately and PLEASE do not say how they get two weeks of 'training' before starting.  Those are two weeks of pushing freight in some other store, or doing their resets and planograms.  If TRU took training seriously they wouldn't leave the Store manager and ASM training to self-taught, hourly team members who happen to have kept their job over several years.  They would have corporate-driven, train the trainer programs to disseminate STANDARDIZED process, not "Well, this is the way I do it" shortcuts from individuals who never had the ability and/or desire to become managers themselves.</advice-to-management>

“Just don't do it”

</title><pros>Pros – Great workforce training programs.  Empowering workforce structure.  Strong investment in process improvements.  Encourages movement within the organization.  Great corporate execution, makes up for lack of plans.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The chickens are running the coup.  In many ways HR has good policies and controls, but delinquent in other ways.  Lower level employees feel empowered to the point where they can be overly aggressive to their management and involve HR if they get pushed back.  Roles are very confining in scope, great if you like to be an expert in a very narrow range of responsibility, but not good for a generalist/executive in training.The company strategy is not analytical and based off of feel.  This is extremely frustrating when presenting obvious facts against a counter ideology that disagrees based on a belief.Had no confidence in the CEO when he spent 20 minutes out of a presentation in front of the whole company asking associates what they should name their Saturday sales event.  Isn't this what you pay a marketing team for?  Sure enough after 20 minutes of alliteration from all corners of the room "Super Savings Saturday" wound up on the flyer.  Some of you may like the inclusion that management gives in this example, but to me I felt like there was a complete lack of organization and structure.Company is owned by VC right now (public knowledge).  This means that they are currently reducing the workforce cost to make the company look better for IPO.  This puts extra workload on the employees and added stress.  I would be very concerned for the companies prospect of surviving long after the IPO when the loans come due.  This is only my opinion though.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management needs to lead from the top and depend on competence underneath them.  The executives need a longer range plan with practical benchmarks and strong continuity.  Strategy needs to be approached in a cross functional manner, not in silos.  Use the strong analytical tools of the organization to support your decisions.  Base your decisions on moving the needle from analytics not making the analytics match your ideology.</advice-to-management>

Store was full of chaos, and nothing ever got done. Got yelled at to do my work even when I was doing the exact  thing they told me to.

They make you do more than what can be completed in a single job day then harass you for not finishing said work.

</title><pros>Pros – -Doing a great job entails getting "ic's" (instant credit applications), having fast transactions and meeting your Rewards goals.  If you can do this, you will be kept on board as a regular sales associate after the holiday season is over.- It's great for college kids or someone who needs a little extra cash for the season and doesn't NEED the job all year.- If you do outstanding on cash register, you will be promoted to Customer Service Rep within 6 weeks.- 36--40 hours a week during holiday season.-They make holidays & birthdays fun for employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Asking about credit cards/rewards can be wearing, especially when the customers get annoyed by it. (You have to ask or else the customer gets a free gift card).-90% of the seasonal people hired will be let go around January 5th.-Can be a boring job.</cons>

<cons>Cons – - very little training, you watch someone for an hour or two and they let you jump right in as a cashier- management is iffy at best, the gm never smiles, and most of the other managers (besides the newest female manager) yell at you for asking for help ( such as when you tell them you need change)-lack of diversity in training- they kept me on cashier all the time while they let others go and do reshop- the clientele seems somewhat entitled ( did not like wainting in line five minutes even at a toy shop close to christmas?) and you have to be on constant alert for scamers at the register</cons>

“Constantly changing, with no real connection between the associates and management”

</title><pros>Pros – The work can be fast-paced and plenty.The people you'll work with are great.If you're apart of the club they like you.Can get any time you want off, and if you don't feel like coming in that day, you will rarely ever get reprimanded.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Do not expect to do varying tasks, if you are good at register or back of house, they will stick you there forever.You will not be defended by management to customers. They will make you look stupid, even though you are following protocol.If you're a new associate, except for a few associates do not expected to be welcomed for about two months.If you're someone who shows up everyday and on time. You will get annoyed by call-in and no-shows who face no problem for not showing up.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Talk to your associates, 80% are looking for a paycheck and to do what they are supposed to, but one out of five wants to have more responsibility, learn and grow within the store. Actually punish people who don't show up, and stick up for your associates. You trust these associates, and they want you to back them up when they make a decision, especially if its the right one. You may not get to look like a hero for bending the rules, but you'll have associates who will trust you and work harder for you.</advice-to-management>

“A horrible, soul crushing, life sucking company to work for”

</title><pros>Pros – Decent benefits for part-time employees ( vacation time, personal time, very basic health care package is available to purchase)    You WILL learn the art of multitasking to the "nth" degree, whether you want to or not</pros>
<cons>Cons – I could write a book-  Let's see, they jam the importance of "guest service" down our throats each and every day, yet continue to cut employee hours to the point that there is NOBODY available to help customers.  The store that I work at is extremely busy- every God-given morning there are people camped out front waiting for us to open, and upper management is aware of this. But instead of having a cashier or two scheduled to be there for opening, they will schedule only one to come in an hour after we open.  So do you know what that means?  That means the service desk associate gets to ring purchases, do returns, adjustments, layaways, internet orders, help customers find items, and answer the 12 phone lines that constantly ring off the hook.  Then, when you finally do get a cashier, they will pull them to the entrance to "greet" the customers coming in the door, because we have to constantly worry about our GSAT (guest satisfaction) scores.  So while people are waiting in line forever, they can look over and see an associate just standing there saying "hello" to people.  They in turn get pissed off and get nasty with whoever is working the front end, and ask why that person is just standing there when the lines are so long.  Then the idiots in upper management wonder why we get crappy survey scores!  They can't seem to fathom that most customers would rather be able to make their purchases quickly than to have someone greet them at the door and make them feel all warm and fuzzy inside.          Our registers and computers are often very slow, which just adds to the stress level.  Half of what's on sale each week will not ring up correctly, and we are constantly having to check signage and our ads because of this.  Why can't things be programmed properly, EVER??  Isn't that somebody's job, to make sure that the sales ring properly?  And when you are up at the front end by yourself and there's no one available on the floor to check the signage for you, you have to run back and do it yourself, leaving your line of customers to do so.  I have never seen this happen in other stores, at least not on a consistent, daily basis.  Also, the air conditioning in our store is practically nonexistent.  In the summer time, it gets so hot and uncomfortable and stuffy in there.  We always have customers complain about it as well, and they will be dressed in tank tops and flip flops.  Try being in long pants, socks and shoes, and a nasty red polo shirt, running around helping people like a chicken with its head cut off!  But do you think that upper management will have the AC replaced??  Of course not, what do they care?  They're sitting on their lazy butts in a nice peaceful air-conditioned office!  They don't have to hear the customers complain about the heat, and they're not the ones getting light-headed, dizzy, and sweating their butts off!          You will never enjoy a holiday, ANY holiday again, if you work here.  It doesn't matter if it's Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter or the Fourth of July.  We always have one ridiculous ad or another out during any given holiday.  The problem is, we often won't have many of the items in the ad in stock, which really angers people!  Or, if we do have the item, we will only have a few of them, so we run out the first day of the ad. (also angering people)  The customers in turn proceed to scream and yell at the service desk associate, because it is their fault after all, isn't it??  Then you will have the people that call on the phones nonstop,as if we're the Home Shopping Network, wanting someone in the store to do their shopping for them.  The problem is, we are always so short-staffed that the people who call on the phones are often on hold for an eternity.  Of course, that's IF the service desk person has time to even answer the phones at all!  Then some of our managers even have the gall to ask why the phones aren't being answered in a timely manner.  Um, hello, I'm alone up front with a line a mile long!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop making your stores run on a skeleton crew and then berate them when they get poor survey scores, quit making sale ads for things that won't be in stock, hire someone to answer phones at the busier stores,  replace broken air-conditioning in stores that need it, give better raises to employees who get good yearly reviews, hire some form of security for stores in high crime areas</advice-to-management>

“Horrible Experience!”

</title><pros>Pros – The retail industry is not suited for me due to the inconsistency,unpredictable scheduling,and demanding (physical) expectations that employees are expected to follow.  However, if you enjoy working in the challenging retail store environment, and if you enjoy working the various inconsistent schedules that the retail industry demands of you, then you would probably enjoy working at Toys R Us.  Not to mention, if you really enjoy being around people and kids, then this job is for you.  There were some nice customers I encountered that appreciated what I would do for them,but some were just plain rude(as is to be expected in the retail industry). Walking around the store non-stop to organize the toys that kids misplaced was tiring and burdensome, but it was a great form of exercise.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Well, let's see....Toys R Us obligates employees to work excruciating hours on major holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving, when they should be allowed to spend that time with their families.  Holidays are meant to be spent with family;holidays are not meant for people to be at work slaving away for demanding customers that didn't want to do their christmas shopping in advance.  I understand that Toys R Us is a corporation, and as such, needs to make money and profits.  However, the CEO and managers at Toys R Us should comprehend and uderstand that the hardworking hourly employees are the ones that contribute to the successes and profits of the company,and without the employees Toys R Us would fall apart.  The  employees' needs for balance in work and family life should be taken into consideration, because in turn employees will be happy and more productive.  Employees are subjected to unsafe work conditions, and management doesn't appropriately train their employees on safety regulations and the safe way to do things; they expect employees to "know" what to do.  There is a lack of proper communication with management in regards to employee safety. Employees are not paid an appropriate living wage, they are expected to work demanding hours on their feet all the time without overtime, and they are expected to work extreme hours just to please the customers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management and the CEO should be humane with their hard-working employees, and they should close the stores on major holidays in order to allow their employees  to spend time with their families.  If you take into consideration that your employees are human beings that have lives and families outside of work, then they will be happy and more productive.  Happy employees that feel appreciated and respected work harder, and they are more productive.  Management and the CEO should close the stores earlier(or not open them at all) on Sundays, because Sundays should be spent with family and not working.  Employees are people with families and lives outside of work, and they are not robots. Pay your dedicated employees a living wage, and treat them like human beings!</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – The people that worked there were the best thing while working at Toys "R" Us. Management gave me a lot of responsibility which I thought was a compliment to my work ethic.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Horrible hours, there were weeks I was working 8 hours a week. There was never really any safety training which I thought was horrible. It was a "go out there and do it" kind of job with little to no training. Like all jobs people were preferred and really unfair. The biggest thing that got me mad was that when I got the Job they told me I was going to work as a Electronics sales person. I was gonna do most of my time in "R" zone (electronics). I was excited for that. I never stepped foot into that place.</cons>

“Management not so great.”

</title><pros>Pros – The people you get to come in contact with are all fairly nice, and the merchandise discount of 10% helps on large purchases like furniture or bedding sets.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The management team could have been more understanding about school schedules and health emergencies. The General Manager of the store I worked at was also not very proficient at the cash registers and helping when backup cashiers were needed. Also, the Sales Associates should have much more product knowledge than they currently have. I've gone back to shop several times after leaving my job there, and the people I worked with couldn't offer me much help with new items I had questions about.</cons>

“Waste of my time”

</title><pros>Pros – The only reason I stay so long was that the medical insurance was very cheap.During Christmas you will have a very good income.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They don't give enough hours, is supposed to be a PART-TIME not ONCE-A-WEEK-TIME. The most hours I've got was during season (Christmas) and I didn't make full 40 hours a week. After that they started scheduling every 2 weeks and at one point I was getting only one day of 5 hours in TWO WEEKS... I was so behind on my bills and having a very difficult economic situation. They did this to every part-time Team Member as far as I know. Also I was always schedule on my "not available" hours when I had school, this was a constant problem that was never resolved. Because all of this I decided to quit and never look back.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – During season treat the employees better. Is not healthy to work for 14 hours straight and being said that if you don't "stay" you will be fire. I don't even think that is legal.</advice-to-management>

“Don't waist any time working at Toys R Us....”

</title><pros>Pros – Easy work, if you work overnight. Flexible hours. Good place to work if you're in high school.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It's a joke. The worse workers get more respect than the real workers. They seem to pay very little attention to who's working and who's not.  Average workers who walk around with their pants below their butt and their boxers showing, manage to be kept, while people who actually dress presentable and put in hard work are thrown away unless they are buddies with the management.I've worked in 2 other retail stores that are actually bigger than Toy R Us and this is by far the worse one. Usually the smaller the store, the better the treatment, but not in this case. It's the only employer that expects workers to know how to work equipment without any training and do jobs that they've never been trained to do. Toys R Us and training don't even belong in the same sentence. Don't even get me started on the lack of break policy. They are picky about who gets a break and who doesn't. Some people have worked all 8 hours without a break and filing a complaint to corporate won't help. The whole entire company is garbage. Wish they would fall off already. They don't deserve the success.I didn't work there long enough to know earn a raise, but the ones who have still haven't got one. They treat everyone as an expendable. If you're over 18 don't invest anytime at Toys R Us. It's a joke.</cons>

“It was OK to work for but not sure if I would go back due to the  Mandatory staying late.”

</title><pros>Pros – 10% employee discount.No Waiting on line for Holiday Sales.1st dibs on the hot new toys.Very Flexable Hours and Days Off.Friendly Employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No matter what time your schedule says you will be leaving they force you to stay and "reshop" the store to put away the toys. I was stuck there until 3am one night even though i was only scheduled until 12am and had to go to my real job at 8am. The next day went back to TRU and again was told it was mandatory that I stayed late because there was alot to reshop and we were not allowed to leave until it was done which took until 6am! Also I was not allowed to take a dinner break or a 15 min break during the 6 extra hours I was stuck there. (I didn't take one before the mandatory staying)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Have the overnight crews that knows where EVERY item in the stores go reshop because they are a lot faster then cashiers that have no idea of where things keep getting moved to. Also you should ask the employees if they are able to stay late and inform them it might be until 3am or later. You can not hold people there for hours and hours extra without them agreeing to stay.Hire more night crew for them to do the reshopping that way the cashiers that have dealt with fighting parents and screaming children all day can go home.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – If you are looking to move up as a dept. supervisor, toys r us is the place to work. They do 80% internal promotions.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They reason why they do 80% internal promotions is so they dont have to pay you that much. As a HR dept supervisor moving up in the company or any other supervisor position, you would make about $2 more than minimum wage, or lower.... depending on how long you have worked there.</cons>

“They expect more of their employees every year with less time and resources to do the job.”

</title><pros>Pros – The company is very flexible. They definitely work with you in terms of scheduling. It is generally a smaller staff in the stores and this promotes a tight knit group of employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company continues to increase the workload and expectations of its employees while at the same time reducing hours. The return policies and lack of the policy printed on receipts makes it extremely difficult for the associates to keep the customers satisfied. With the right resources and hours the stores could do well. Unfortunately this is not the case.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Come into the stores and see what your employees are going through. You can't add in extra services that create extra work and then reduce hours. Your employees are frustrated and stressed. Get back in touch with your stores and the reality of what the customers and employees need. And please put the return policy back on the receipts! As a consumer myself, I think it was a very poor choice to remove it.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – The weak 10% discount makes your purchases tax free, then 3% off.'It's a job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management doesn't post the schedule until less than 24 hours before that schedule begins, making it impossible to know when you work.Revisions are made to the schedule (hours cut) without notifying those who are affected.Low pay with low, not often, raises.Expected to take on the roles of 3-4 people with little to know training at all.Under 6 hours you are supposed to have a 15 min break. *Almost never happens*Over 6 hours you are supposed to have a 30 min lunch break. *Only if you have a reasonable manager on that shift*I've gone 7 hours straight here with absolutely no break....just more ridiculous commands.</cons>

“Should be better”

</title><pros>Pros – I found some very hard working people there.Taking care of the kids makes you feel great</pros>
<cons>Cons – No bonus, Minimum Discount, No travel...  There is absolutly no advantage of managing in this company.  Why do you need 4+ managers opening by 7am? I know...  So you can use them as free labor being that they are on salary.  No way should the managers do what they are doing.  But this is the business they believe to be successful, however it will not.   Be prepared for some of the sillyest problems that will drive you insane on a daily basis (item not on file, not enough computers to help more than one guest at a time, return policy? haha.  its just turrible)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Change... Every aspect.  You cannot have your DM's micro manage the stores in which they are not even in.  you Have 4-6 managers per store.  If you make up a "front end manager", what role does everyone else play?  It seems like the verterans get the easier part of the job.  Its sad but im sure this business will be belly up soon.  Oh yea.....  your return policy is by far thee worst ever.  Thanks for making my days difficult due to your insane return policy.</advice-to-management>

“The most stressful and most thankless job I've ever had.”

</title><pros>Pros – It's better than being unemployed.  Team members are over all very hard working, cooperative, good intentioned, and very friendly to work with.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is less than other big box retailers.  There is no extra compensation for holidays, for which  they are open for all  except Christmas.  As a DS, you have no say in how or when you are scheduled, you have to offer open availability.  There are weekly "turnaround" shifts, where you close and leave the store around midnight, and then have to be back at 6am.  In a year, I only had 2 days in a row off once.   The store manager where I worked crushed the morale of everyone working there.  There was a 100% turnover in in one year.  Training was on the fly, in a very high volume fast paced store, most of us were figuring out things as we went.  GSL leading, was very frustrating, because we had to coach the cashiers to sell bpp's, batteries, rewards and instant credit all of which most people didn't need or want.  They tracked the numbers on these add ons and if the numbers where low as a DS you were held accountable and could be written up for that.  When you quit, any earned vacation time is not paid out.  You lose it, but you gain the opportunity to find a better place to work where you'll be more respected.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – - People are overall pleasant & friendly- Hours are generally good (40 hours/wk)- Management does take the time to communicate company development quarterly- Management is committed to improving the business</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Bonus incentive is nominal and is tied to company & international performance which makes it hard to really motivate- Promotions can take a long time;  Lateral moves are encouraged and more frequent but the company policy is not to give pay increases for lateral moves- Company overly focuses on bringing in MBAs - it's a core requirement, but any MBA from any school is fine. Quality of education is irrelevant for this company, you just need the degree. This leads to a VERY wide range of talent all at the same title- Too many test initiatives + analysts who don't know how to interpret data properly-No tuition reimbursement-HMO healthplan is affordable, but POS plan is very expensive, especially for a family.</cons>

“It sure beats being unemployed!”

</title><pros>Pros – My coworkers are the only real enjoyable part of my job experience so far.  They are very helpful and courteous towards me.  I look forward to going to work because of them.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I absolutely loathe the corporate section of toys r us.  I understand that the bottom line is what matters the most for any company.  THIS company, however, puts the bottom line above treating its employees fairly.Store managers are forced to cut hours, on a biweekly basis due to unreasonable corporate demands.  We recently lost an assistant manager, and our other assistant manager just put in his two weeks notice.  The logical response would be to increase the hours of its hourly employees (who make less than or equal to 1/4  of an assistant manager) to help compensate for these losses.  Instead, corporate decides that it will "front" us 30 hours.  By front I mean, that they will let us go over our allotted weekly hours, but we will also have to pay these hours back.  So basically, they put us into a worse situation for the future.  This is because we will have to cut hours in future weeks to make up for the 30 borrowed hours.I could go on to criticize the lack of on the job training, the pay, and the other unreasonable demands (metrics, planograms, etc.) of the corporate offices.  Unfortunately reviews are not allowed to contain rants or obscenities so I will cut myself off.</cons>

“Too much work and tasks and not enough people and hours in a day to accomplish.”

</title><pros>Pros – If you are a High School student or college student that will be satisfied w/low pay, little hours and not a lifetime career at Toys R Us...this is your job.As far as manager careers the pay was good for me although I was recruited at a high pay compare to most.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Everyone gets hired at minimum wage regardless of your years of experience and skills unless you are hired as a supervisor/manager.Training program is awful no hours budgeted for that and not enough people scheduled to buddy up and train a new employee.Even though they close at a certain time, be ready to stay about 2 and half hours past that and during holidays until sunrise, and it doesn't matter whether you have school or come back and work next morning.I recommend everyone not to start employment at Toys R Us during holiday season.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You have to make training budget to invest in people if you want less turnover and return on investment with the performance and customer service they will offer to guests. "People" are the most important asset in any company, it takes talent and skills and happy employees to help a business grow.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – U get a checkyou get to combine coupons with your discount but its rare if you get a good one</pros>
<cons>Cons – the discount is horrible i miss kb toys @ least that  job gave you 30% off purchase where as @ TRU its 10% for some over priced toys and you can not use it on the game systemsand the only time you really get any hrs is during peek season which is from OCT-FEB after that u n need to get a second or just a better job in generalwhen hrs are cut you have to do every thing yourself u have to be the greeter, cashier,sales floor rep, replenish, cover breaks all while your friend managers stand around ans complain about what they have to do which is pretty much nothing all day everydaythe managers use to take company time to have manager luncheonsOh yeah forgot The manager use to take cigarette breaks every 15 mins</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – hmm if you kiss up to the dept supervisors and assistant and store managers  then maybe just maybe u might get manager numbers to override simple transactions that they feel that they don't want to handle...become part of one of the clicks they have going on and talk about everyone's personal business like thier lives are not a hot topic in the place</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Work here only if you need a job in a bad way.  Initial salaries are competitive for Store Managers.  Again,   unless you are desparate, stary away from ToysRus.  No self-respecting professional has any business here.</pros>
<cons>Cons – 4th rate retail.  The leadership at the company thinks TRU is relevant.  It is not.   It is not fun, you have no resourses, and your are micromanaged.  This company does not even pay you for accrued vacation if you leave--classy!   Stay away from this company.  If you work here--over time-- you will be embarrassed and angry at the company, its mis-management, and its blatent disregard for Team members.  There is a reason why you can at any given time find multiple listings for store managers in every TRU market.  This is 4th rate retail.  Stay far, far away.</cons>

“Oh, by the way...”

</title><pros>Pros – It was a decent pay and 65% of the managers/supervisors treated me ok. There was a discount: 10%--ooh, watch out.Babies and little kids that talk to you in the checkout line are cute!Working around babies, toys, kids and electronics.If there are any, using walkie talkies!</pros>
<cons>Cons – It was a little out of the way, like a 15/20 drive. So 3 hour work shift weren't really worth it in between classes.On the last day (Christmas Eve) one of the managers said, [literally] "By the way, [for those of you that didn't know] this was your last day of work." Oh, thanks. Wish I had known that.The computer prompts for batteries, credit cards and special donations. When a person wants to make a donation I have to go back 3 screens to get to it. Doesn't make sense.Lousy discount for seasonal.Notice about the 8,000 things that goes on sale every week would be nice, you literally don't find out until you walk in the door/get to your station or a customer brings you a coupon.Customers & coupons: 'nuff said.Restock and recovery. Especially when people are in the store.Walkie talkies: 40 people, 15 walkies (if that) you do the math.Not enough people working at some times.Upselling so much stuff</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop pushing the batteries and Credit cards, if people want them they will buy them.Who is the genius that put the "Toys for Toys" button *BEFORE* the prompt is sent out?</advice-to-management>

“Fast paced and fun, but management structure unstable”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a fun place to work especially if you like to be around children. The work isn't difficult, you just have to have patience and be able to work with aggravated and unruly parents at time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – During off-season, business drops so low that there are hardly any hours to pass around. If you were on for seasonal, there's little chance that they will have need for you after wards. The way they lay off seasonal is very unprofessional and they give you no heads up. Seasonal was supposed to end January 15, but once we clocked out on Christmas Eve, they told us that was our last day. Felt bad for people who really needed the job.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't treat employees like cattle; even if they are seasonal. I was there for a bit, but I was a better employee than most of their regular employees. We put in many long and hard hours and deserve to at least be treated with respect. A week notice would have been better than clocking out and then being told that was it. Hire better managers who know what they are doing.</advice-to-management>

“Very unorganized, Hard work is not rewarded.”

</title><pros>Pros – Flexible scheduling, you let them know when you can and can't work and they will only schedule according to your availability. Affordable health benefits, even for part-timers, paid vacation, and accrued time off. Excited new parents and discount on cute clothes if you have little ones in your life. also discount at Toys-R-us.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is a joke. I was started at $7.90/hr with 2 years retail experience, an adult working to support a family, making what I made as a grocery cashier in high school. There were never enough available hours per week, I went from getting 30 hours/wk the first month, to under 20 hours per week when I finally left 1 year later. There was no training and no matter how hard I worked or how much praise i received from supervisors I was never moved to a full time position despite many request and inquiries. Employee satisfaction surveys and focus groups were a joke, because nothing ever changed, and we were never supplied with the tools or knowledge we needed to do the best job. Customers looked to us to be experts on the products we were selling but we were never given the time or information to learn about many of the products.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Train your employees! There were so many terms, policies and programs talked about in the morning huddles (idea stolen from Target, that was not used as effectively as Target), that I had absolutely no idea what they were and were never explained. Everything I learned how to do I learned by trial and error, even using the cash register. And show your good employees some appreciation, I saw many great employees walk out because they weren't treated as such.</advice-to-management>

“fun place to work.”

</title><pros>Pros – You get to play with toys pretty much all day. In fact, you're required to. It's called 'demoing'.Unlike grocery stores such as Wal-Mart and Safeway, where people have to be there to get their weekly shopping, most people are shopping at Toys R Us for fun.The people you work with are usually friendly and management, supervisors and long-serving associates are pretty good at helping newbies learn the ropes.Working in a toy store genuinely is as fun as it sounds.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hearing 'Elmo's Song' constantly repeated all day long.People messing up displays and shelves so that nothing's where it's supposed to be.Other associates can often be 'cliquey', which can make a person feel somewhat left out.Management can be lax sometimes.Having to try to force people to buy batteries and buyer protection plans for everything.Pay could stand to be better, but it's not terrible.Too many Zhu Zhu Pets.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Big box retailers like Target and Wal-Mart are undercutting us quite badly. I'm tired of hearing people say 'Well, this is great, but we can get it cheaper at Wal-Mart'. If they can charge discount prices for toys, so can we.</advice-to-management>

“16 year old level job..”

</title><pros>Pros – You get to look at cute babies all day.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They messed up my pay I never once got the hourly pay I was promised, I finally called the lead of HR and got a check for the money all my pay checks were missing. This took weeks! No one talked to me about how I was doing or what I should do. A lot of drama between coworkers, try and stay out of it as much as you can but someone will try and suck you into it. You have to stay later than your shift hours to clean up the Toys R Us side after everyone is gone since that side is such a mess. You have to push credit cards, batteries etc. VERY FEW people actually buy either. Great job for a first high school level job but nothing you will want to stay with.</cons>

“It's retail...”

</title><pros>Pros – You're surrounded by toys.Discounts if you need them.Hours are pretty flexible.Hard work will be met with recognition.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the girls you work with that have been there a while before you tend to have attitudes and look and talk down to you.  They are still in or barely out of high school, and like to be bossy, but when it comes to doing something when it's busy, they whine and tell you to do it.  It's a toy store, not Trump Tower.   Lighten up and be a little friendlier to new people.  If you're that miserable or think you're so much better than everyone, find a new job.  Another thing- you're at work, so stop with the texting.Some of them are not very knowledgeable about products.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The last thing a customer wants to hear are offers for 5 different things when all they're trying to do is purchase their items and leave quickly.  About 90% of them decline batteries, BPPs and Instant Credit plans.Give some of these girls some friendliness lessons</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – They will use and abuse you till you think it is over then do it some more.  As a manager don't expect any time off, six days a week, even sevens, are the norm and you never get that time back.  If you like treating employees bad this is the place to be, the thought is they work better if they think they will be fired.</cons>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – -Pay your employees a living wage.

If policies are made to be a blanket that includes corporate as well as store level, then the store teams should be allowed paid holidays with their families as well.-Focus on the succession planning.</advice-to-management>

“Not Worth It!”

</title><pros>Pros – If you enjoy seeing kids smile, that part of the job could be okay. There's also a 10% discount which, though not much, it helps with the TRU exclusives.</pros>
<cons>Cons – HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. At the one i worked at, the manager was completely inconsiderate and not at ALL compassionate towards his employees. Everyone is easily replaced & he treated us all as if we were simply numbers to him... Which is all you are.THERE IS NO TRAINING - at least not for seasonal help. I came in on my first shift ever, and was thrown onto the customer service register, meaning I was also responsible for answering the store phone & dealing with grumpy customers - on, and i repeat, MY FIRST DAY.THE REGISTERS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT ARE TOTAL GARBAGE. There is both a touch-screen monitor and a keyboard on the registers, and it was sheer luck as to which one would be working at any given time. Whenever I needed to type something out on the keyboard and my keyboard wasn't working, I had to send the customer to a different register, which is annoying & tedious, and half the time, they told me not to bother. Also, the hand-held item scanning device was continually not working & then we would have to unplug it & reset it. This happened at least 7 times per 6 hour shift.THE METRICS ARE RIDICULOUS. You have to ask EVERY customer that comes through about a credit card, batteries, a buyer protection plan, a loyalty program, AND a donation to charity. Even when the customer's purchase is toys that don't require batteries, you still have to ask them. A woman came through my lane to buy a package of m&m's. Obviously, she's not interested in batteries, right? WRONG. According to the management, batteries are essential to candy consumption, as well as anything else you may buy in the store. Same deal on the credit card. Yeah, you get 10% off on your purchase if you sign up for the credit card.... but if you're only buying one or two things, do you really care? What with all the paperwork needing to be filled out for the card, I'd assume not.ALL IN ALL -- work here if you're desperate -- there's no other reason to.</cons>

<cons>Cons – I felt at eighteen that I was the most intelligent person working here. It's really hard to listen to a manager when you know that there is absolutelu nothing going on up there. I felt like I was surrounded my morons. They were nice people, but morons!</cons>

“Hired as Cashier, later became a jack of all trades”

</title><pros>Pros – My co-workers for the most part were great. most guests could be decent while interacting on a one on one basis. coming in contact with many products in the more traditional toy, as well as the electronic and video game departments. learned and worked in almost every department of the store. some days working several departments at once or on one shift.</pros>
<cons>Cons – middle management could often be a lot of talk with absolutely no guidance or help. not enough help at key times of year. lack of communication from higher ups in the company that allowed employees at our particular store to be told by guests that "we heard this store is closing down soon", long before any of us heard any such thing. our store was falling apart in many regards, but they did close it and move to a different location, one with the new baby's r us combo stores.</cons>

“Don't do it!!”

</title><pros>Pros – Babies are cute, most associates are easy to get along with. The job can sometimes be really fun. Easy work for most people.</pros>
<cons>Cons – management is incompetent,  crazy people shop there. Raises are a joke. Associates don't get enough hours. The best people get treated the worst.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Quit changing everything so often. Can't even finish a project before someone changes it all.  More communication.  The auto scheduler is lousy, employees who have been there for years get less hours than new people and I don't buy it when you say it's because of their availability.</advice-to-management>

“Impossible to Advance”

</title><pros>Pros – You work with toys, the work is not mentally challenging.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Everything else. Poor pay, poor management, poor accountability. No opportunities to advance. They treat their lowest associates poorly, and as such these associates rarely stay later than they have to, and subsequently their leftover work falls on the backs of those who actually care about their job. I'll give you a hint, the backs being strained aren't a part of management.</cons>

“Not fun place to work.”

</title><pros>Pros – Able to meet nice people and see happiness in kids faces when they find that special toy. Fun place for kids.Thats it!</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not fair place to work. Not all people are treated fairly.Upper management does not keep in touch of the climate of the stores. Don' t address problems until their boss is about to visit.Thier main focus is to sign people up for credit cards, warranties. Helps pad bottom line for management bonuses. Lost focus of authentic customer service and selling actual products.Un-ethical people allowed to work in management. Some employees bad mouthed behind their backs. Confidential information shared around stores by management.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hire ethical people to run your stores.Too manay managers curse, don't work, leave early, bad mouth their employees and don't care about their jobs. Only when you (their boss) come in for a visit, then they work us to death to impress you, when stores look like crap day in and day out before you arive and after you leave. They are running the company in the ground. One day you will wake up.</advice-to-management>

“Where do you begin???”

</title><pros>Pros – Dealing with fun retail categories.  New store formats are pleasant to shop and have potential.  The last toy store standing.Serving some of the TRU loyal customers.  Finding their niche product they couldn't get at Target.Interacting with the kids.</pros>
<cons>Cons – TRU drives its' bottom line on sales of worthless paper...credit card bounty from credit card companies, buyer protection insurance add-ons.   Sacrifices service and holds transactions of these items as a golden carrot to entire store.You are required to query numerous batches of data to report sales metrics.   Scrolling through electronic journals to find correct information.   Very redundant and a waste of stores' time.  You spend more time manipulating metrics than being a merchant and working with customers and store's team.Pay rates for hourly associates are low and very few full timers within their staffing plan.  To the point where you rely on many hourly associates that can't pass a drug screen elsewhere, or were terminated from another big box.Recently rolled out additional cuts to staffing structure.  Very similar in nature to Circuit City 2007, eliminating some of the best producers in the stores.Very little incentive to be a long term hourly associate at TRU.  Very few full time positions, very small yearly raises, no incentive bonuses, no incentives for driving sales of their BPP and instant credits....Except for perhaps getting a few more hours a week than a non-performer.Tools you work with, outdated store systems, scheduling, none work with each other.   Store schedules for all associates are budgeted extremely bare bones and corporate continues to find ways to decrease budgeted hours.    Must spend hours updating worthless information on when running weekly schedules.  Very outdated system.Register systems extremely dated.  Not at all user friendly.Excessive gimmick driven ads that are never backed by having correct inventory levels.  Constantly out of product immediately when ad would break.They will not put any money into existing stores as they have a dream to once again be listed publicly after multiple bankruptcies.   Also trying to roll out a new combo store format and letting old stores die.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Treat this company like a real retailer again.  Stop with driving worthless paper at your customers.  Have fun with your stores.  You are the last one standing.  Wal-Mart and Target both cutting down selection in toys.</advice-to-management>

“It was good for the most part.”

</title><pros>Pros – If at any moment you needed help (whether as a cashier or dealing with a customer), the supervisors were very willing to do so.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The only thing I have any sort of complaint about is the way the head manager speaks to people, but he was rarely seen anyways. Other than that, I had a great experience.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I think they are working just fine. I do not believe they need any advice. Customers will always complain about little things, but other than that I find that no customer or employee really has anything to complain about.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – Not every store manager is helpful in doing your job. Depending on your store, politics may play a gigantic influence on who gets pay raises.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – District Managers need to engage ALL store associates more frequently, to take a pulse on how effective store leadership actually is. Ineffective store leadership = low morale = low sales.</advice-to-management>

“horrible place to work, you will be treated like a slave”

</title><pros>Pros – at first it was a nice place to work at. i got job experience. and made a few good friends.</pros>
<cons>Cons – At first it was a great job but after a while i realized only the seasonal people were working. the people that had been there before was able to talk on the phone and tell everyone else what to do. if you were new you werent allowed to talk to anyone, and you were treated like slaves. its a very disrespectful work place.</cons>

“terrible”

</title><pros>Pros – If you can't find a job anywhere else work at toys.  You can hold games and such as an employee.  Not much else to say.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Managers are condescending and disrespectful.  You will be offered no praise for doing good work but a slight mistake is made and they will crucify you for it. Terrible raises.  Horrible organization among the upper management.  YOur value as an employee depends on how much of the metrics (buyer protection plans, rewards, batteries) you can push on the customer. Hours are ridiculous especially if you are a college student. (store will close at 12 am..lol a toy store., and you wont get out until 2:30 am sometimes)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't be condescending towards employees because they will have no morale to do a good job, especially when you never commend anyone on doing anything good, but are so quick to react when someone messes up. if your a bad manager do yourself and everyone a favor and just quit. your going to bury yourself.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Offer competitive starting wage.  Friendly and helpful co-workers.  Fun work atmosphere.  Helpful department supervisors.  Good for part-time or seasonal work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Don't expect store managers or assistant managers to care much about you.  They preach open door policies and talk about their desire to work with you, but when it comes time to act, they fall short.  Managers and supervisors play favorites with certain employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Start practicing what you preach.

</title><pros>Pros – - Campus is great w/a lot of resources.- Pay and bonuses competitive with other companies.- Work/life balance is the best I've experienced anywhere.- No long hours, little pressure from deadlines.</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Systems are sub-par given the size of the company.- Politics reign supreme here.  You will not get anywhere unless you play the political game and play it better than the others.  Promotions are given to people not based entirely on merit.  Merit is only 20% of it here.  You won't be recognized for good work unless you're a good sweet talker.- Communication across departments is pretty bad.  You can't get things done without making multiple calls.- Worst part of TRU is the lack of transparency.  Upper management is very secretive about their plans going forward and the company's performance overall.</cons>

“Great for a Part Time, Transitional Job”

</title><pros>Pros – When you leave, you leave your problems.  Atmosphere is usually positive, other associates are helpful and friendly.  There is flexibility in hours to work.  The customers are great.  Expectant parents are usually very happy in anticipation of their upcoming big event and that comes across when you do business with them.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Schedules are posted usually be Wednesday or Thursday for the next week.  Therefore, it's hard to make personal plans for that week.  I've seen it where the schedule wasn't posted until Saturday night and the work week begins on a Sunday.  It gets worse if you work in a specialty area like furniture.  If they need a day off, they have to switch with someone else from the furniture department.  This makes it hard to have an outside life or find someone else that will fill in for you.  The store is extremely short staffed recently---they just let go all their F/T long term employees.  The employees were told that they could re-apply for p/t positions and would get the prevailing wage for a new associate.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There are three areas for improvement: more staffing so we can make our sales goals and interact with our guests (as R Us wants), improved warehouse management (ours is a safety disaster waiting to happen and takes 20 minutes to locate something when it should be quick), and post the schedule at least 2 weeks in advance (JCP used to do it a month at a time).</advice-to-management>

“Fun and Helpful Employees with Horrible store managers”

</title><pros>Pros – I was there for almost a year and up until the last few months it was amazing!  I loved everyone I worked with and the way the company was ran.  I actually loved going to my job every morning.  The best reasons to work their are the discounts, knowledge (I now know almost everything I need to have a baby), customer service ( they really do care about customers), and all of the huddles/ communication.  I never felt confused, I always had someone to ask for help.  I felt very connected with the company and responsible if something wasn't done right or sales goals weren't met.  I liked having the ability to make my own decisions and help customers the way I saw fit.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Turnover and low morale, along with crappy incentive packages.  I don't have kids so the discount is really helpful for me.  I would have liked a tuition pay package for working their for so long.  Most everyone their was in college or wanted to go to school.  Managers really tried to keep everyone happy, but their was so much drama with not enough hours and favoritism that it was hard to keep the morale level high.  Managers are scared of DM visits because they don't do their job the rest of the time.</cons>

“I have been there......”

</title><pros>Pros – Its what you make it. Some managers will be worthless, but some are very good. Its about who you work with. People quit people, not companies.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Season, (Christmas), kiss your family goodbye in November. Pay a little low, performance is critisized constantly. If you cannot sell batteries, warrenties (BPP), open new credit card accounts, then do not bother, these are what will get you there, or out to the curb.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Focus on happiness of associates and management. You ask entirely too much from understaffed stores, and you continue to cut payroll while expecting everything from replenishment to re-merchandising to numerous reports all day.  Revisit Operation Guest Engagement...it has flaws. I know, I helped develop it.</advice-to-management>

“Fun, but not a long-term commitment.”

</title><pros>Pros – Had some great co-workers at the time, but this varies from location to location and year to year. Fun, management was stern but fair. There is a 10% discount, but this discount cannot be applied towards video game systems, some electronics, diapers, and baby formula. The discount is good for all other items and is a plus. The co-workers were very close knit, almost a family. Often spent time with them after work. This closeness and openness made work more tolerable and the environment healthier. I believe it also helped with sales by utilizing friendly competition.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not a lot of room for growth. One very talented employee had been there nearly a decade without growth, another several decades without growth. There are no health benefits for part-time employees, and management would not hire full-time employees. Many part-time employees were working full-time hours without benefit or extra pay. The pay increase was not very much after nearly 2 years of working and always meeting and exceeding my numbers, making near minimum. Did not adjust hourly wage after minimum wage went up, so I essentially was given a raise to minimum wage 2 weeks before the change. Would not raise upon request.</cons>

“R-E-S-P-E-C-T”

</title><pros>Pros – Fun place, good co-workers. Good if you have children and need to buy things like diapers and formula.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Pay isn't that great and no benefits for part time work, at least that they let us know about. Management had very little respect for the associates, the higher up you went the worse it got. The 10% discount wasn't really stretching their pocket. Also they weren't very accommodating to changes in you schedule and even if you asked for time off often wouldn't change it and would tell you it was your job to find a replacement for a day you had requested off previously.</cons>

“A typical retail store”

</title><pros>Pros – Typical job in which 'sales associates' work the floor (includes shelving, organizing, assisting customers in one department) aside from front-end support jobs lead to extra pocket money.The work itself is not terribly hard and those willing to partake in the holiday shopping season will certainly welcome the extra hours. Hours & availability are all negotiable, though some instances they will not be able to accommodate. However, for the most part (particularly in Wayne store), they will try to fit it to your schedule.Also, those working part-time will get discounts too. So if you're looking for certain boardgames, console games, books, gifts, etc, what better can it get! Also you can check out the clearance items after the season is over too.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Too many long hours. Christmas season is very hectic (need to be prepared mentally) and hourly wage is average for this job.</cons>

“toys r us store manager review”

</title><pros>Pros – good employees and and innovative management team.  Working with parents that saw thier childrens experiences though their childrens eyes was quite heartwarming and mad going to work each day tolerable.  The employees were generally young high school students that had a high turnover rate so you had to weed out the losers quite frequently.  The christmas season was a little tough because you had to fire so many good employees that gave blood sweat and tears during "season.'  It was just a way of life....use em and fire em!  But I suppose ther was no other way or someone would have thought of it.</pros>

“Toys "R" Us Indifferent to service; metrics mean everything”

</title><pros>Pros – If you like cooing over babies and little kids, TRU is a good place to be. Co-workers are fun, and the environment is okay. If your kid is sick, the managers don't hassle you about missing work. The in-store discounts are wonderful. Working mothers can fashion their available hours after their schedules. Most employees are helpful and cheery, which is a nice thing to walk into. Most managers are also helpful and happy to be there. Many repeat customers come to see you. Community outreach is good, especially at Christmastime. There are usually enough toys in the store to make just about everyone happy.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No matter how conscientious a worker you are, the bottom line--"metrics"--is the only thing that counts. Although I have seniority over others, metrics is what drives the hours you get to work. Even if you have repeat customers who like you as a person, it doesn't matter. A manager recently tossed a phone book at one of the new hires and said "find some Birthday Club signups." These kids have been randomly taking names and making up kids names in order to get the number of signups required on their goal cards. Hours are seriously cut for those who don't "add up." The managers really hassle you if you have water at your cashier station, despite the fact that cashiers are expected to chat up each customer. The excuse? You're told you can go to the water fountain when you're thirsty. It's not easy to do that at all!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – People come back to the store because of service. Relying solely on metrics is unrewarding for both the customer and the worker. There is little room for advancement unless you play the game, and fake metrics scores.</advice-to-management>

“Overall, Toys R Us is a good place to work.”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a company that is undergoing some big changes in corporate structure. More integrated (Toys R Us and Babies R Us) Super Side-by-Sides will be opening. This is giving more room for career advancement. Full-time associates get Atena Insurance. It is very good. Part time associates can also get a limited health insurance called Starbridge.It is normally a fun place to work, I enjoy it.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The constant pushing of  associates to sell instant credits, buyer protection plans, batteries, etc. There is a lot of pressure. There is no standing around. Whether you are at a register, or on the floor, there will be tasks to be completed on your  "down time." After January, everyone's hours get cut, even the full time associates. Making it through January until May on fewer hours in hard.</cons>

“Toys R Us review”

</title><pros>Pros – It's often a fun environment with all the toys and excited children. It's satisfying to bring a smile to a child's face, and to help a clueless parent find something worthwhile for their child.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is not much communication and training from the management. The management at times complain to associates about less than stellar gstat scores, but the company hardly trains and guides the employees on guest servicing, SOPs, product knowledge, etc! They way things are done in the store it seems like most people (including managers) are just randomly "winging it" as they go along. A lot of people work hard and are kind of disillusioned by the lack of acknowledgment for the work they do by management. There are hard-working, helpful, friendly people working there, but it's at times jarring how some managers and associates there are rather cold and impersonal towards each other. They don't seem interested in interacting with their fellow employees and act like they don't want to be approached for anything.The head store manager's presence seems non-existent in the store. Most employees have never seen THE store manager and have absolutely any idea who it even is. This person is cooked up in their office most of the time. Strange how someone can be in charge of this particular store but walks around in it only once every few months (usually just to go shopping or greet a VIP visiting the store).The company can at times be stingy providing hours to its employees, even if it's a very high volume store that needs a lot of help and work done. The salaries offered to associates is not competitive with other major retailers in the area. It's no wonder why a lot of great employees quit and work at other retailers.The company discount (10%) is seriously a joke, and excludes a lot of major items. Major retailers typically offer their employees at least double that rate year-round, and some offer triple (and up) that rate.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be more approachable and in-touch with your employees. Acknowledge the hard work your employees do. Acknowledge the mere existence of your employees! Most of you were once associates too. You should never forget what it's like and how vital they are in the operation of the business. Also, you should work more directly WITH your associates so the store is run more smoothly. This is mostly basic, very common sense stuff, but is not practiced extensively in the store.Also, the salary, benefits, raises, company discount should be competitive with what other major retailers nearby offer. Otherwise you will keep losing a lot of great workers.</advice-to-management>

“Whats my title again?”

</title><pros>Pros – If you like kids, there will be a ton of them there. There are a lot of toys to play with as well if you're into that sort of thing. Overall a good "first job" type of place where you can screw up a lot and not get in trouble or fired.If you work in the morning, there is a lot of time to get your job done, after the store opens however, every single person is an associate and cannot continue their regular duties.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No training at all. The managers kept all of the hourly employees in the dark as to how the store was doing or where we were at. The only thing management cared about was protection plans and not punching in too early.When my job position switched after a week of working as an associate, no further training toward my new job was completed. I was told to come in earlier and that was it, no formal about my new duties. For a month I was only doing two portions of my job until new management came in and told me that I actually had several other duties.Returned/used merchandise was returned to the floor to sell as new, even though some items were obviously used.No one ever said, "good job" or "bad job, do it this way instead." I wasn't doing my job right for a month and the managers said nothing.</cons>

“Big Changes at Babies R Us”

</title><pros>Pros – The people are very nice. Other stores will help you when you have questions. Everyone wants the company to be successful and are willing to work any amount of hours and make personal sacrifices to make it happen. The company used to have no "season" which allowed vacation and personal time to be taken during holidays, however this year things seemed to change and it looks as though time off during holidays will be going away to provide support to TRU this is based on conversations with people who still work for the company,</pros>
<cons>Cons – Advancement is based on how much the DM, RVP, HR, LP  like you, not on store performance or personal performance . The CEO is ruining the brand. The store have had hours cut in half and managers are performing a lot of the hourly jobs as well as still having all of the managerial responsibilities. Many long team managers seem to be driven out of the company or can not adjust to all of the changes.</cons>

“Toys R Us Review from Sales Associate POV”

</title><pros>Pros – Easy going workplace. The people you work with are great. Most of the management team is very good and helpful. The team prides itself on our cleanliness. Most of the employees are extremely knowledgeable which makes your job easier. Everything is organized to a certain degree. Extremely flexible with requested time off, as well as earned time and sick time. If you work hard you will be compensated, just don't expect it to land in your lap, you will have to persue it and make your intentions known. There is great communication between corporate and stores as well as stores to other stores.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Pressure for metrics (Warranties, Batteries, Instant-credit sign-ups). Sometimes the management team will make real bonehead decisions. Customers believe that I am actually their slave. Listen if I am lifting an enormous box over my head and its clear that I am struggling, please don't stop me to ask a question. Customers also believe that they are queen and or king of the store. I am not going to bend backwards for you because you think you are the most important person in the store. Everyone needs attention too. Up until the holiday season, the schedule coverage is absolutely horrid. There is an extreme amount of pressure on the hours that are given to our store.</cons>

<cons>Cons – Low pay, lot of respect, bad management.

“If you care about how much you make please don't work at Toys 'R' Us!”

</title><pros>Pros – Management is very friendly, nice, and understanding. It's also a lot of fun playing around with toys when it is very slow (especially in the morning times). You also get a discount (I believe 10%) off almost everything in the store and you get to hold items that you want that are on sale or clearance.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay! Compared to other companies it is very low! Plus you have to constantly offer customers credit cards and service plans and ask for donations for certain things (for Children, usually around Christmas time). All of this would be ok but you don't see a dime of it since there is no commision pay. Also, the employee discount only covers basic toy items: No electronics. So unless you are still a child at heart or have kids around there isn't a whole lot to use your discount for. Oh, and by the way, after Christmas, if they don't let go of you, you will be hard pressed to get many hours unless you have exceptional experience and skills.</cons>

“Toys "R" Us is great for kids.”

</title><pros>Pros – Working with children is very fun. Kids these days have so many different kinds of toys and advances in technology have helped kids gain more knowledge about things. You have a chance to see how toys have changed throughout the years from simple to futuristic. I never realized that toys sold so easily everyday to adults who had children at home. During the holidays, the store was so packed that you couldn't really have time to clean your section because you were helping customers left and right. It was a fun experience and I would work there again if I had free time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There are so many workers that you don't really get a chance to have a lot of hours to work. During holidays, you might just be hired for a seasonal position, which means that your job may be temporary. If you are a good worker, they may ask you to stay for another season. There is a high chance that you might get called in on your days off if other workers don't show up for work. It is roughly 15-20 hours for part-time workers, which I had applied for. Working at Toys "R" Us can be quite hectic if you are not up for a challenge.</cons>

“A company still trying to find their way.”

</title><pros>Pros – The enormous wealth of knowledge you can gain from experienced team members, knowing about the deals and promotions before anyone else, ability to earn decent vacation and paid time off based on the hours you work. Also, they have a vast amount of knowledge on the company intranet so that you can search and learn basically anything about the functions within the store and the various products.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The biggest downfall that I've found while working at Babies R Us is the lack of professionalism through out the company. Every where from store level all the way up to corporate it seems like there isn't much follow through and there is a general lack of commitment. There are high expectations for the Dept. Supervisors (and part time associates, for that matter) yet no training program set in place. Its a sink or swim mentality and you are ultimately the decider of your fate in the company. There are a lot of empty promises and very few rewards for your accomplishments. Hard work is expected and the only reward you get is a pin for your name tag. They consistently do contrary to what they promise and blame it on the circumstances. They promise and/or threaten to keep written proof of accomplishments and pitfalls in order to manipulate a persons performance. There is very little management involvement and straight answers are difficult to come by. A lot of issues seem to be taken personally and you can always find management standing around gossiping with their favorite associates. Over all it is a very frustrating atmosphere to work in and the only thing that has kept me there so long is the Supervisor team I work along side.</cons>

Focus groups are provided for associates to vent and air their frustrations, and the same is not provided to management, yet management is held accountable to what some disgruntled employees may say.

<cons>Cons – Christmas season, you work til around 2am.  Closing the store and doing inventory was the worst part of the job.  The managers don't really have any sort of training program in place.

</title><pros>Pros – Managers are scheduled 9.5 hours. Managers are also paid hourly, so working retail, this is good. You are paid time and a half for work. The downside of hourly work is that in California there are meal violation laws. As a manager, it can be very difficult to pull away from tasks. Also, TRU is hiring! Leaders recognize that the only way that they remain competitive in retail, is to hire good leaders. The company seems to be very open to new suggestions to improve store performance. Marketing is good. Parents are able to save a lot of money with the many coupons.</pros>

“Appreciate good staff and reward them and get rid of the payroll wasters.”

</title><pros>Pros – Discount for employees just barely worth it.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lack of respect from the top to bottom.  Far too many staff members tend to talk down on their " equal" co-workers.  No one seems to know or care if you are there to hang out and bs all day.  But if you don't, beware because they will come down on you like a brick house if you actually do you job smoothly.  They like to throw all kinds of orders at staff just because they have a souped up name tag.  They don't seem to not recognize a person that can function and do their job without feeling that they must tell you 3 times even if you are in the middle of doing exactly that task.</cons>

Do not assume that low paid staff means ignorance.  There are a lot of brilliant people working at Toys R US.

</title><pros>Pros – The health benefits for full time employees are very good and affordable.  Management is genuinely concerned about their employees both at work and with their personal lives. It's a really fun place to work, you get to help expectant parents with all of their baby purchases. There is great opportunity for growth and advancement within the company. They always prefer to promote from within rather than hire from the outside.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay rate isn't that good, the hours aren't very good, and the vacation time isn't very good. You have to be out of work for a minimum of three days in order to use your sick time. It's difficult to get ahold of anyone at the benefits center if you have questions about anything.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to the store workers more when they have ideas. These are the people on the front lines dealing with the customers every day.</advice-to-management>

“An enjoyable work place.”

</title><pros>Pros – During the majority of the year it is an easygoing place to work at.  Business picks up big time in mid Oct thru the New Year, as would be expected.   However the number of employees also increases then to cover the bigger crowds.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I have enjoyed my time working at Toys "R" Us.  I can't think of anything negative.  As with most companies there is the big stress to get more sales of waranties and batteries, as well as credit apps.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Make sure old as well as new employees feel appreciated and compensated.  With the ever increasing cost of living it should be just as important to keep your current employees as it is to rncourage new people to work for you.    At the same time as I said before I enjoy working for the company.</advice-to-management>

“Good opportunity to become part of a turn around”

</title><pros>Pros – Assuming you perform well in your current position, it is easy to move around the company thanks to an initiative from the CFO to promote internal recruiting and interdepartmental knowledge transfer.The corporate headquarters is understaffed, which leaves extra opportunity to step up and shine.Toys R Us is privately held and going through a "turn-around" phase.  We are starting to make up some of the lost market share to our major competitors Target and Wal-Mart.New successful Toys R Us strategy: Toys has rolled out a promising initiative to place Toys and Babies stores next to each other to capture more of the transitional age group between babies and juvenile aged children.  This new concept has been successful and is being rolled out to the rest of the chain.Brand equity.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The location of the corporate headquarters in Wayne, NJ is unfortunate.  The commute to Wayne, NJ is long from NYC or Hoboken, NJ. The traffic is horrible and owning a car in NY/NJ is very expensive.  Unless you're married with kids, life in suburban NJ could be depressing for a young professional.Toys has a very hierarchical structure, which makes it harder to get things done unless you go through the right person who has a high enough position within the company and connections.  It is important to travel through the appropriate channels to accomplish a certain task, which reduces productivity.The current budget for pay raises is close to nil.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Employee retention will be a problem with the current budget for annual reviews.</advice-to-management>

“Toys R Us is not a fun place to work at, even though you are around toys all day.”

</title><pros>Pros – There's not many reasons, the only one I can think of is my fellow co-workers.  There are a great group of people that work at the store I am at. I can't even say the discount is great, because it's only 10%.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The training is insufficient. I realize it's hard to effectively train everyone at Christmas time, since our staff triples during that time, but I'm sure that a new and more effective training method could be put in place, especially training on different products in the store.  We carry many electronic items in the store, and most people, even those that work in the electronics section, don't have a lot of knowledge on the different products they are supposed to be able to sell.   Feedback is not something that is frequently given, whether it be positive or negative.  Advancement opportunities, especially at the store I work for, is not something that comes along often, and does not seem to be a priority either. At my store, it seems as though the store manager gets the right people in key positions that make him look good, and he does not move them up from there. For example, an assistant manager position opened in our store.  Two supervisors that were more than qualified for the spot applied for the job.  Neither one was even given an interview for the spot.  The position was eventually given to someone outside of the company.   Lastly, the pay is not competitive at all.  Someone would probably be better off working at Wal-Mart than at TRU.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There needs to be more communication throughout all levels of management, and more feedback needs to be given, whether good or bad, and performance problems need to be addressed immediately instead of letting the problem progressively get worse.</advice-to-management>

“We keep politics on aisle 6c, and high school games on 4d....”

</title><pros>Pros – Helping moms make children smile.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company is reorganizing after a buyout two years ago.  However the vast majority of the store level and district level leadership remains in place.  These remaing managers are more concerned with playing politics and attempting to protect their jobs than executing the new leadership's vision for success.There is no system for tracking the actual hours worked by salaried managers. Salaried Managers fill out a management time log, but that information remains at the store level and in never transmitted or reconciled anywhere.  This means that the controlling authority (the GM)  is able to  work half days as compared to what they are actually scheduled.  They are free to not work at all, and then claim a week later that they did work according to the schedule.  This has led to serious abuses of sick days, eto, and vacation days.  The ASM is expected to be present the entire shift, and frequently exceeds 60 hours per week compared to the GMs 35-40 hour weeks.  Complaints of abuse to higher are simply routed back down to the GM's in question which typically results in action against the reporter.  I have personally watched disciplinary actions against hourly associates for 1-10 minute late arrivals handed down by a manager that consistantly cheats the company out of 8+ hours per week.  The hourly associates see this and it does nothing to help store morale.  Additionally, the GM is the only one that is bonused at a variable rate that can be sizeable.  Combine all of these points and one is left with some seroiusly disgruntled employees.Plan o Gram documents frequently do not agree with graphics installation instructions, the layout pictures typically violate the standards of excellence for merchandising, and the layouts usually will not agree with the product list as shown in the diagrams.Store hours have been cut to bare bones staff resulting in a closing staff for three people for a 100K sq ft store.  This is a constant complaint by shoppers on our satisfaction surveys.  At my store we usually have less than 400 hours to split between the entire staff.  Salaried managers make up this shortage by working extra hours.Special projects are also frequently mismanaged by corporate from the beginning.  I was allotted 80 man hours to reset and create a section of improved and new aisles.  The right  size shelves were not shipped to begin with. The proper shelving uprights and base decks never arrived.  The right plans were not published to fit my store layout, the new product still has not arrived, and we have ordered the correct material twice now.  This was supposed to be complete 20 weeks ago.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get control of salaried managers worked time by making them clock in and out for attendance purposes.Make the silent witness hotline actually "silent" The hotline does no good when the info is relayed right down to the GM it is concerning and they get to solve who "ratted" them out, and then has the ability to dismiss it as a disgruntled person who called simply because they were counselled for job performance.Bonus employees for performance affecting the bottom line.  Reward for credit card,extended warranty placement, and assembly dollars.Make the aisle layout documents agree.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – The pay really sucks. I made more working fast food with less work to do.You have to do a lot of work.Terrible customers. Most are always out to get freebies/discounts on things that don't need them.

“Store level talent is not appreciated.”

</title><pros>Pros – The people I work with are the only reason I stayed with the company this long.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They are all about working harder, not smarter. People at the top see all the profits of the company and the hourly employees who work very hard putting together projects dictated from corporate, never are appreciated. Senseless work is done within the store which wasted money, time and discourages team members from being productive.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The people at corporate making up all the projects and moves that happen within the store, have probably never worked at store level, so they are completely disconnected from reality. My advice is listen to the store managers, have a better exit strategy for product, lower prices on formula and diapers, and stop being so stingy with coupons. The company wants to be competitive with others but doesn't understand people will shop around for a better deal, customer service isn't always worth a price hike on toys of up to 30% or more.</advice-to-management>

If I didn't specifically request time, I got MAYBE 6 of those days off, and NEVER both unless i took personal or vacation time. Even though the other assistant would have been willing to work opposite weekends with me. NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY.I did not hang out with the Manager and the other assistant. So I was never "trustworthy" to them because I did not break company policy with them...HR Does not take complaints of any employee at any level seriously.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Figure out a policy in which divorced parents whe get to see their kids 4 days a month get to see them the 10 months of the year that it is not Christmas season...</advice-to-management>

“What comes next, nobody knows...”

</title><pros>Pros – Great team of hard working nice people. No back stabbing. Beautiful campus.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Future is uncertain. Potential IPO has been looming for years. No one knows what happens if the company does not go public. Because of the pressure to perform the burnout factor is increasing. Layoffs have been happening in spurts for many months leaving people on edge. People have been promoted and then subsequently laid off so getting a promotion is no guarantee that you are safe. Management will neither say that the layoffs have ended nor that they will end any time soon. Management turnover is high. CEO has a reputation of not being so nice to employees in meetings.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – I have a jobMost of my coworkers are pretty kind peopleClose to my homeMy schedule is flexible, which is great since I'm a college student</pros>
<cons>Cons – The hours suck - Sometimes a part time employee will receive 30 hours while another will receive 8The supervisors and managers push for our metrics and give you shitty hours if you don't do wellRarely do the managers congratulate those who do a great job out on the sales floor yet they'll kiss and bend over for the cashiers doing well with metricsThey don't reward promotions to those deserving of themUnderstaffedThere is usually only two registers open, Customer service has to deal with returns, sales, phone calls, computer work and in store pickupsRzone has to deal with sales, getting games out for people and other various thingsPeople don't seem to get trained wellSome stores are near bad areas and they get demolished by guests, then district managers come in and complain about the mess, we can only do so much with the hours and staff we have!For a big company, the internet we get is really slow.They refuse to fire managers or supervisors who do poorly in their job and who are less trained then a part time associate</cons>

There were many times were breaks came at random, most days would be 8 hours straight on my feet.</cons>

“Toys R Us has lost it's focus”

</title><pros>Pros – Nothing better than working with kids and toys.  Training is good in the off-season, spotty during busy times.  At least they have updated their uniforms to the 1970's.  Probably not a bad place for part-time job, but I feel sorry for the kid's wanting to start off here.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Ridiculously bad customer focus.  This company is so worried about it's bottom line and stock price that it has forgotten who and what got them this far.  Very poor working hours during the season, 70 or more hours per week, with the promise of comp time during the off season.  But they make the mangers dump all of their help and then it's only you and two other people to run the store every day so you can't take any time off.   Company is cutting expenses so severely, we can't even maintain the building.  I can't believe anyone still shops here.  Upper management is so conflicted, we can't get a straight story from anyone.  District manager has no idea what they are doing, no retail knowledge, no product knowledge, no inventory knowledge.  And speaking of inventory, the managers have no control.  They pump product into your store without any input, product you don't have room for and couldn't sell if you did.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – They know what to do, they just won't do it.  I don't think management's attitude towards it's employees will every change, but the least they could do is take care of their customers.  Good luck,  Toys, I can't seeing you making it last much longer.</advice-to-management>

“Be more flexible”

</title><pros>Pros – There is a gym on campus as well as a cafeteria- the food is pretty good. Summer Fridays (but you have to make up the 40 hours elsewhere during the week), friendly people, good starting salary, good parking. If you like a true corporate environment, not like a small business at all, then this place is for you.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Toys R Us mandates an hour lunch, so you end up being at work for 45 hours a week. It would be much better if a fifteen min to half hour lunch was allowed and then employees could leave 45 min earlier and tend to family etc. Toys R Us is corporate to the core with a lot of set rules and a rigid hierarchy. Most people move around laterally for years before moving up and its seems as though some people are swamped with work while others have nothing to do. People don't seem happy in general and my part of the office is dead silent during the day and it can be depressing. Besides that, there is not a lot of time off.</cons>

“Overall, pretty good”

</title><pros>Pros – Pretty solid paid time-off and vacation packages, reasonably priced medical/dental insurance. Opportunities to advance within the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lower end of the pay scale for big-box retailers. Most employees are part-timers, and thus have little to no investment to the company. Very difficult to find talent that is willing to do the necessary work when they are getting 15 to 20 hours weekly. Push "metrics" way too vigorously, to the point where it frustrates the customer.</cons>

“Where is the company going???? Your employees don't know!”

</title><pros>Pros – Good place to learn what not to do for your next management position. Coworkers are friendly. Overall Good product line up.</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Coupons are horrible and guest are always unsatisfied with the options for its use.-Signage is a joke because the distribution center never has the items shipped to stores for promos.-There are entirely too many SOPs to keep up with. Apparently there is no one in the company that removes the old information. So good luck finding the most up to date SOP.-I'm not sure that Toys R Us knows who there direct competitor is because they compete with everyone. If they narrow the focus of the company they might find a single direction for the company to follow for the future.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Narrow your focus and company goals so that everyone can be on the same page. You need to over haul all of your technology because its a joke. Your Logistics system is a complete mess. You cant sell stuff if your store is empty.

“Too much too soon with too incompetent shift managers”

</title><pros>Pros – They provide good hours, a 10% discount, and train you in different areas.  The employees I encountered were nice and some were willing to help.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Train you to do too much too soon.  I couldn't learn their cash register system with them trying to train me every other day in a new area.  I would have loved to learn all of it, but I needed a couple weeks just in one area only.  The shift managers were very bad.  One of them was always watching my every move to make sure I did things right.  Stressful, right? They expect you too get it quickly and it's just hard.  I quit after a month and a half.  The customers were fine, the managers and some employees were just idiots.</cons>

</title><pros>Pros – You get to help customers and coworkers are overall friendly and welcoming. Coworkers really are great to work with.  Each day is different and brings new challenges.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management is under trained and not prepared to do thier jobs. There is like no reward program for hardworking employees. The schedule is put out only days before it starts which makes it basically impossible to plan your life.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Put the schedule out sooner. Try to increase overall moral by giving more rewards for good work. Decrease turnover by training managers more.</advice-to-management>

<cons>Cons – New tasks were added to the mountain of work daily; Pay was very low - some individuals who have worked for the company for 7 years still do not make $10/hour; Stores running the juvenille test created additional work, less creativity and far more stress - it went from a fun, creative place to work to a stressful, aggrivating place.</cons>

“Not exactly the "World's Greatest Toy Store".”

</title><pros>Pros – Having worked as both a part time associate/cashier and as a full-time store supervisor, I would say if you're not expecting to move past part-time, then the company is a good place to work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – In 3 years working there, I never recall an increase in how many hours the store had to give its' workers. Even when the hours were increased during the holiday season, I remember hearing from many long-term works that the increases weren't as much as years past. You cannot continuously cut hours, and yet still expect the same, or even increased, results. It just doesn't work that way. And speaking as a shopper, I have never been asked as many questions by a cashier like the company expects theirs to do. Asking if someone wants to apply for a credit card, sign up for a rewards card, buy batteries, join the birthday club, and make donations, in addition to if they found everything they were looking for and if they need anything split onto separate gift tags makes the transaction take too long. Don't put all of this onto cashiers, and then offer $5 gift cards if a cashier forgets to ask something.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop cutting hours. Give some more time to allow your "sale associates" to really go out and sell things to customers on the sales floor.</advice-to-management>

Despite not knowing about certain procedures, they will try to write you up for not doing them.  Inventory system is horrible.

“It's retail”

</title><pros>Pros – Depending on the store, it can be a fairly laid back environment at smaller stores, which is nice, as you don't work with that many other people. The employee discount is okay, but nothing to write home about.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It seems like there is always something new to push on to the customer, whether it be donating to a charity or some new program, which takes time at the register, when you have people complaining how long it takes to check out.</cons>

“Sign up here for salaried legalized slavery”

</title><pros>Pros – The people I work with are awesome for the most part.  The company is horrible.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Completely unrealistic goals as to what can be accomplished in a day with the hours and resources given.  As a manager or ASM, only way to get daily and weekly goals accomplished is to work every day for more than 12 hours which wears you down both mentally and physically over time.  Corporate management has no pity whatsoever for their legalized slavery to store managers.  Pay offered to hourly associates leads to bottom of the barrel (in many instances) hourly associates who do not stay long.  Constant turnover due to poor working conditions.  You will have no life, especially during holidays when you will be forced to work even MORE hours than normal.  Kiss your Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas goodbye because you won't be having them with your family.  Constant threats of being replaced for supposedly underperforming- however, no one is actually ever let go because everyone at other stores is in the same boat; barely being able to survive and putting on "horse and pony shows" for the DM's and regionals and hoping for the best.  Favoritism and politics rampant in upper management.  Ads and specials are horribly thought out by corporate with never enough sale merchandise, which angers customers (and the customers are right).  However, you will be held responsible as a manager when customers give bad scores on feedback surveys due to circumstances you have absolutely no control over (in stocks).</cons>

“Avoid This company if you can”

</title><pros>Pros – The team members that work there tend to be very versatile and knowledgeable for the most part.  Everyone is very hardworking and good at their job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company does not have a very good structure of leadership.  They try to run the stores as if they are a true big box store but it more of a mid box.  75% of their sales come from the last few weeks of the year for christmas that the rest of the year you are running on barebones.  There are never team members in the store and they make the assistant managers work like Team Members.  The Assistant Managers seem like a Department Supervisor position and the Store manager an Assistant because the District managers MicroManager the stores.  Things that are suppose to get done never do because they make a million priorities and there is no staffing to do it besides you.. the Assistant Manager, and they expect you to run a business also!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Give the Assistant Managers bonuses! WE are the front lines and we deserve to be compensated as so.  During christmas, do not roll out new programs and expect everything to go smoothly while we are running 17+ registers and every aisle is on the floor.Re evaluate the location accuracy.  Take a note from a real big box store Target and notice that their planograms are 100% located down to the label location so it is easier to do reshop, packout and inventory adjustments.  Why should i not be able to tell a guest that their toy is in aisle 82, second section, 3 shelf up, 2nd label to the right.</advice-to-management>

“I love My coworkers, hate corporate”

</title><pros>Pros – I love my coworkers, and my managers. They are really flexible with hours and availability, and will work with me on my hectic and demanding schedule as a full time college student.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I believe that someone else had already made my point. Corporate sucks! They cut our hours and demand more. than when we aren't able they blame us and punish us by cutting more hours and demanding even greater quotas! The store is a mess, building wise. We make tons around Christmas, why doesn't corporate use some of that money and give recognition to it;s employees??? And mandatory holidays are awful.  You start at a usually lousy pay rate, and from there the raises are minimal and only happen once a year.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Corporate! Recognize your workforce, we are the ones that make you money.  Treat us well if you wanna make more. Don;t be idiots a happy work force means that we are more loyal and hardworking, stop thinking JUST of the profit margin!</advice-to-management>

“Like all retail, it depends on the people.”

</title><pros>Pros – Friendly place to work if you get along with other coworkers. Some of the managers are decent people who will cause no problems or grief.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Depending on the size of the store and staffing you will most likely be understaffed outside of the holiday season. Some managers can also be very detrimental to the morale and throughput of the store.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – If you have a manager that somehow manages to screw up the schedule week in and week out, and cause the entire store to dislike said manager, it's best to get rid of them.

</title><pros>Pros – Great co-workers, organized, informative and promotes strong team work, management is kind. Toys "R" Us can also be a peaceful and easy working environment if you take the time to get to know other employees. Reasonably demanding and management is fair to everyone.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If your a bike assembler, it may be best to have prior experience. Even though fixing the bikes is easy, management expects a certain amount of bikes to be produced in an hour. When I was there the demand was 4. If you haven't fixed or at least taken apart bicycles prior to working as an assembler, be prepared to learn quick. Production is important to the Toys "R" Us team and as an assembler your expected to produce quality fast. If you already know how the transition will be easy, but if you don't expect words from management.</cons>

“Rude”

</title><pros>Pros – Fun to work with toys.Flexible with scheduling.</pros>
<cons>Cons – rude customers and rude corporate. corporate wouldn't listen to anything the managers said. incompetency everywhere. very little discount for employees. I was told to force customers to buy more. we had a successful store but we were expected to make way too much and we closed because of that. everything we did was monitored. we had to straighten merchandise and line it up perfectly the whole time because corporate might come around in disguise and run their hand over the merchandise and it had to be smooth. bar codes couldn't be showing either. the back room was full to bursting because corporate wouldn't stop sending our small store truckloads of toys every week. it was like the managers hadn't complained when of course they had. we received toys that nobody wanted, which made it even harder to meet our ridiculous goals. we had Christmas music playing after Thanksgiving at full volume. when our customers would complain, we cashiers would turn it down but then we would get yelled at by our managers because corporate told us to have the music blaring. this drove customers away and it was frustrating because we were there and could see and fix things corporate couldn't but we weren't allowed too. I was in almost constant fear of losing my job because I was getting 15 people signed up with reward cards in 4 hours when most people already had one or had good excuses for not needing one. Selling demos was a constant concern. someone always had to be outside with the remote control car we were trying to sell in case corporate came by, even when it was scalding hot or freezing outside. and they didn't like us to wear jackets because it covered up our uniforms.</cons>

<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – ~Everyone working in corporate should spend at least 40 hours inside a store.~ Focus more on training new and existing employees on products carried in stores. Baby items are a little more complex than you think. Every employee should be trained in installing a carseat.~Management should have more time on the floor leading their team~No one person should close a store 4 nights a week when there is 1 manager and 3 supervisors.</advice-to-management>

“I have been very happy at Toys R Us.”

</title><pros>Pros – The way that my store works with employees' personal lives is most important. And everyone really cares; it is easy to forge friendships. Managers do not suffer from inferiority problems. They recognize team members as intelligent people. There is opportunity to learn and advance if one is willing to work hard and do a good job. This may be specific to my store. Most team members have been there over 5 years, many for more than 20 years. They're doing something right. New managers sent from outside do not last long if they try to lord it over employees or do not pitch in with the hard work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The pay is miserable. No one should be at any job for 10 years and still be making one dollar over minimum wage, even if it is part time. It can't be that these are such incompetent people that they don't deserve more, or they would have been let go long ago, or driven out. There aren't that many full time positions available. I sometimes don't feel motivated to work because it occurs to me that it isn't necessarily worth it. When the managers ask us to push something to make them look good, we balk at the impertinance of it because we are already undercompensated. Yet no one quits because of the nice atmosphere that can't be found elsewhere. Backstabbing and gossiping, considered typical of retail, stems from the necessity to claw your way up instead of relying on recognition. When corporate heard the complaints, they instituted a "peer recognition" process wherein team members and members of management write little messages on tiny pieces of paper to tape to a bulletin board. So we now have proof who the favorites are, and who stays out of the fray, The latter are usually the awesome employees who still have not received official recognition or advancement because they are too proud and dignified to care about those little pieces of paper. The only pieces of paper many of us would like to see are green and have pictures of presidents on them. There are those who have the manager's ear who, out of competitiveness, knock down other capable employees. That shouldn't be allowed to happen.</cons>

“Worst Experience of My Life”

</title><pros>Pros – The pay was good at first because the company wanted to lure managers in to work for their lousy company. However, once I got promoted, the pay was not where it should have been as a manager and they were not willing to negotiate.The customers are generally a good crowd. The only thing that kept me going to work each day was knowing I could see little kids or babies have a smile on their face and get what they wanted/needed from the store. Some parents were nice. Some were mean and rude, as with anyone other people who shop at big box retail stores.Getting to know about new toys coming out is also somewhat exciting.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Pretty much everything. Where shall I start?The company is very old school. In college, we learned about "the good old boys" club and how that mentality used to rule Corporate America. I thought that was the way of the dark ages of business, but this is still the way things run at Toys R Us/Babies R Us. If you aren't "in" with the good old boys, then you are definitely "out" and by that I mean they will find a way to push you out if you don't kiss their rear ends in every which way and lie to their faces about how much you and your team can accomplish. Most of the people who are in upper management (District level and above) presently are people who worked at Toys/Babies before it was bought out, so they go promoted on the old school way of doing things and have no idea what it's like to work in the stores nowadays.As a manager, you are given very little training when hired. My training period consisted of me reading the outdated training materials on my own and spending 4 weeks trying to figure out their very archaic ways of doing things on the intranet and store systems. Oh yes, and don't forget about their millions (OK, sorry, I'm exaggerating, I mean thousands) of "Standard Operating Procedures" or "SOPs" as they call them. You'd better get an early start on reading all of those people, even though upper management doesn't even know what's in them, you better know! Oh, and don't be surprised when many of them are incorrect or haven't been updated in years.Coming from another big box retailer who was a bit more advanced in technology, I felt like I was going back to the 80's or 90's when I started working with Toys R Us. They make very little investment in their stores technology and building maintenence and it definitely shows. One store I worked at had cockroaches and mice. Fabulous. But, don't spend too much money on Service Channel trying to get things fixed up around the store because you will blow your entire budget and basically you will run out of basic supplies like toilet paper on a regular basis, even though you've already put an order in weeks ago. The tech help desk is headquarted in India and regularly takes days to call you back.Also, there's no money budgeted for employee morale at all. If you want to buy a soda for a team members for getting 20 instant credits in a week, you better pull out your wallet! Or better yet, use your last reem of copy paper to print out cheesy peer recognition cards and write them on of those! Hip Hip Hooray! The pay for the employees is very low. You can't offer starting pay above minimum wage unless you are hiring for a speciality position or higher. So, a high school kid taking his first job gets the same as a 50 year old who'se been a cashier at WalMart for 20 years. Lastly, if you are a store manager, be prepared to have some of the most incompetent assistant managers you've ever worked with. They will also want to leave right at their 8 hour mark, or maybe even earlier, on a daily basis. But, not you, you get to stay and work on the schedule until the store closes! That's why you get paid the big bucks, right? Why would any company put a Store Manager of a big box, multi-million dollar store on schedule duty? A schedule usually takes 8+ hours to write if you are doing a decent job. Why would you have your highest paid employee spending that time in the office when they could be on the floor leading?Many of the managers who were there when I was hired left the company within the year I worked for them. Many of them couldn't handle the changes and pressure coming from corporate. Most of us managers had no life outside of work. I consistently worked 12-16 hours a day, sometimes more, to get my job even somewhat done. The reason this happens is because there is not a good training system set up for employees. I created many things for my team, such as "buddy training" on the cash register because Toys/Babies doesn't even have a consistent way to train new people on the cash register. They not only throw the management in with no training, they do it across the board. Also, you will be training a lot of people because if you are a decent manager, you will create some movement when you come in to the store. So, on top of trying to turn around one of their many "broken" stores, you will be training lots of new people with very limited resources on top of your regular duties.If you are lucky to get some tenured team members on your staff when you come in as a manager, be prepared for lots of push back from tenured people who want to challenge any of your ideas and who have no remorse for reporting you to the 1800 hotline for HR. Oh, and don't trust HR either, because they will turn their back on you faster than lightning. It's pretty much every manager for themselves, unless you can find a couple other managers who are just as unhappy as you are who you can vent to on a weekly basis (a common call I received each week from a few of my coworkers).So, if you don't deliver the results they want within a couple months, be prepared to start getting written up and talked about by upper management. They have no compassion at all for throwing managers into "broken" and underperforming stores and expecting you to turn it around and undo years of damage in 2-3 months with no additional resources. You will need to come in under payroll and get at least an 80 on your weekly metric scorecard. Oh, and many of the "favorites" of the store managers are the ones who cheat on the metrics yet somehow fly under the radar.Toys R Us would like to think they are progressing. They have come up with the Guest Service Leader (GSL) program, which is an engaged MOD program that requires a key holder to be on the floor with a clipboard and performing 'coachings" and such at all times. However, they do not execute these programs well at all. In fact, they fail at launching the programs but yet expect store teams to follow through with them seamlessly. The same thing happened when they launched a new truck unloading process, a new price change process, and many other major processes they attempted to launch, yet provided no resources for stores to learn them. This is essentially digging their stores into deeper holes.Basically, my advice to you if you are considering becoming a manager with Toys R Us or Babies R Us is to RUN like the wind FAR away from this place. DO NOT be lured in by their offer of a higher salary or advancement opportunities. Well, unless you subscribe to the "good old boy" mentality. Some new hires who I would consider major tools somehow are still there. But, if you aren't a major tool and actually want to have a life in the near future, stay away.I have a college degree, four plus years of management, an IQ of 165, got promoted with this company in less than 3 months, worked my rear end off every single day down to my last day, yet somehow I got the strong feeling I wasn't good enough for Toys R Us/Babies R Us when it all boiled down to it. I threw a year of my life a way and wish I would have just said no to it all. It was a horrible experience. I wish I had listened to the former employees who told me not to join this company when I got the offer.Trust me, I am not the only one...I know at least a dozen other former managers who are really, really good managers and friends, who were high achievers at their previous, well-known Big Box companies, who quit and I know even more who are looking for employment elsewhere. Many of them want to go back to where they came from. You are probably better off just staying where you are. Anything is better than Toys R Us/Babies R Us.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I will be thoroughly surprised if Toys R Us is successful in the coming years. They are under some really poor direction and management throughout the entire company. I suspect this is the reason they almost went bankrupt once. I wouldn't be surprised if they go bankrupt again. If upper management really cared, the would spend some quality time in their stores and not be judgemental of the management. They should actually be hands on, help unload a truck. Help out with apparel and see how hard it is to run that department with 48 hours a week. Work on a busy Saturday in Baby Gear or Electronics by yourself and see how messed up the ads really are. There are so many things I could say, but why? They will continue to demande store management to put on a one horse show for them on their quick walkthroughs while they text away about lunch plans or Buy Buy Baby spy-sessions on their company Blackberrys.Oh yes, and Buy Buy Baby really is a better store in so many ways than Babies R Us. I wish I could have just said that to the upper management on my last day working there.Any rational company would attempt to retain newly hired managers and long-term managers. It is a very well known fact that hiring and training new people is a very expensive and time-consuming process. Yet, if you do a search for jobs on their career page, you will constantly see that they are hiring for managers in every area of the country all the time. This is because they do not care about retention. They believe management, just like hourly team members, are disposable and replaceable. It is the most backwards way of thinking and doing business I have ever seen in retail and in general. The way this company is being run is virtually insane.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – Except for seeing the smiles on the kids faces, there are none that I can think of. The awesome 10% discount you get won’t even offset the cost of sales tax in most places.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lousy store level management. On paper I am a Department Supervisor, in reality I am nothing more than a high paid lackey for the Store Manager to blame her professional short comings on. In my short time with this company I have been subjected to so many different levels of incompetence that it boggles the mind. I was written up on my first day for violating the company’s meal policy. I was counseled for wearing a pair of pants that did not meet the company’s dress code. Ironically enough it was the same pair of pants I had on when I interviewed (as a current employee) with the District Manager and the Regional HR Manager for a new position.I have had a store manager that dressed me down over the walkie talkies that we carry allowing any employee and customer in the store to hear it. I’m still owed over $500.00 in insurance premiums that were wrongly taken from my paycheck and over $1,100.00 in travel expenses that were never reimbursed but submitted 3 times. My hours were cut from 40 to 29 per week after Christmas yet I am still considered “Full Time” because they will only cut them for a period of about 12 weeks. I have seen employees with BA and BS degrees in Business Management and years of management experience denied a promotion or full time employment so a person with 2 years with the company could have the job.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get your lazy butts off of the soft upholstery and get into the stores to see what is really going on. Stop announcing your visits weeks in advance and just drop in. Your regional managers and district managers have yet to see how a store is actually run.Stop thinking that you are the end all and be all of the toy market. You are nothing more than another big-box retailer, period. You could learn a lot from other retail management if you would climb down off your high horse and listen to the men and women you hire externally.When you hire a full-time employee externally treat them as a professional. It is hard to justify why you are cutting the hours of your Dept. Supervisors and Asst. Managers by saying hours are not available when we see part time employees getting 25-30 hours a week.Try using some useful tools like exit interviews when employees leave. Maybe if you saw why they were running like rats leaving a sinking ship you could do something to stem the flow. Standardize your promotion requirements and training for new employees. If you ask 3 different Human Resources</advice-to-management>

“Not hard work but unfulfilling and poor management”

</title><pros>Pros – -Several of my fellow employees were nice--Got the number of hours I requested-General work environment was not bad.</pros>
<cons>Cons – -very little training- I was seasonal but some of the permanent employees had this problem too- (I never did get to learn how to use the sapphire...)-As a seasonal employee, you are basically told that you have 0% chance of staying if you can't get absurd numbers on card sign ups and such. This made me had very little desire to put forth my best effort in my work-Management doesn't care about you at all- I was out working the floor for 6 hours straight and was wondering when I would finally get my lunch; as it turned out they forgot that I was even there. (And forgot my name to boot) I know I was seasonal but that's still very unprofessional.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You are expected to just sort of figure out everything as you go along which, may be fine for some jobs, but when you are trying to help or check out customers, speed and accuracy are required for the customer to not get angry- I would advise Management to spend more time training their employeesAlso, seasonal employees are your employees too- you should take time to at least learn their names. I often felt like an outsider at TRU- if you were to make seasonal employees feel more welcome, they may actually pull those crazy sign up numbers.</advice-to-management>

“Challenging career with high demands.”

</title><pros>Pros – As a salaried manager, you have a steady income and benefits to include 401K, medical, dental, vision, and bonus opportunities.</pros>
<cons>Cons – High pressure to meet unrealistic goals which gives you the feeling, if you don't meet those goals, you will lose your job.  As a Manager, your told to hire more associates your budget can support, then you are reprimanded for exceeding hours.  While you are being told to cut back on hours, the company extends store operating hours, increases the daily work load beyond capacity,  and expects you to have certain number of associates working at specific times but when you add up all the hours you are "told" to use, you find yourself over hours.  This is a recipe for failure.  I was working 12 to 14 hours a day 6 to 7 days a week to try to meet the company's expectations but it was never enough.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Go back to caring about your employee's.

“One year is enough!”

</title><pros>Pros – The co-workers are very friendly and do want to teach you and help you out.  Even the supervisors are like your friend, except the managers definitely divide themselves among the rest of "us" since they are not supposed to be seen too friendly or even to be hanging out with us outside of work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Most of the time, the store is understaffed because the company is trying save payroll so 5-6 people working in a store is not a surprising thing.  Thus, the management expects you to do everything and anything even though you have 6-10 tasks on your plate already.  OH! There are usually five different promotions that an employee HAS to sell to customers at the same time so the customers feel bombarded.  If you do not offer or tell ALL the promotions to EACH customer, the management will have a "talk" with you.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – HIRE MORE PEOPLE WHEN IT'S NEEDED!!!! ESPECIALLY DURING WEEKENDS!!!!! Customers always complain about bad customer service and not enough products on the floor is because we are understaffed most of the time!</advice-to-management>

“An Okay Place to Work”

</title><pros>Pros – -Everyone that works there is friendly.-Flexible hours-Management always honors requests off when they're on time-Relatively easy job</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Guests are typically very condescending and rude, which gets old.-There's often times little to no coverage when the registers are backed up, or you need to go on lunch.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – -Train employees in a few different departments to make them more knowledgeable, and train everyone as a cashier for back up.-Don't let every guest that throws a fit get their way when it's against the company's policy.-Implement a drug test for incoming employees.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – the catch phrase is "Great Place to Work" and the Regional staff is excited to promote this.  Benefits are decent and it's a good atmosphere to meet people.  Try to make improvements occasionally to help customer service</pros>
<cons>Cons – Like most retail it can get very hectic.  This anxiety is made worse though by the corporate mentality of a new project every couple of days.  Once you are done resetting something, corporate will have you completely change the program.</cons>

“Don't Work Here Unless You Have To”

</title><pros>Pros – The flexibility of scheduling allows part-timers to be off when they need to be. Most of the associates are friendly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – After the Christmas season hours are cut to the bone. Sometimes there is only one person on the salesfloor. Part-timers get 8-12 hours a week (if they're lucky)  until business picks up in the spring. Fewer associates working adds up to fewer and fewer people doing more and more work.</cons>

“Eh...”

</title><pros>Pros – If your a guy, hot moms. If your a lady, hot dads. Haha.Cute kids who are often unintentionally hilarious. They REALLY appreciate what they purchase!Popular w/family and friends w/children who want to use your 10 percent discount haha.Can make lifelong or at least good friends while working there (as well as have romance).I'd agree that the schedules are pretty flexible.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Asking the same 7 questions over and over and over again (wanna sign up for an tru credit card? wanna extended warranty with that? do u need batteries today? do u need gift receipts today? would u like to donate to (fill charity in here)? do you have a rewards card or would you like to sign up for one? what's your phone number? your also supposed to ask about if their kids are part of a birthday club tru has, but that one's not as enforced as the prior seven.No communication whatsoever when it comes to changes and new policies or promotions or whatever. Your pretty much on your own there.The intense pressure management puts on you to get five credit card sign ups, seven rewards cards, five buyer protections plans, etc. EVERY FRIGGIN DAY! There's almost always subtle hints that if you let them down your stock will go down on the team (ala less scheduling).Why is TRU too cheap to hire a greeter/security guard? It's no suprise shrinkage is pretty bad compared to Wal Mart or Target.Why can't TRU order products online to be shipped for customers to their stores like B&N does?Because it's a toy store, when adults get upset at an employee it's always worse because of kids disappointments compared to an adult buying something for themself at like Macys or something.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get rid of the 7 questions (or stop with the free 5 dollar gift card if you don't ask) as not to force employee's to keep saying the same stuff over and over (and seriously, why do you have to ask somebody buying a barbie if it needs batteries?). If anything, stop the five dollar gift card for not asking and bring it down to four questions (credit card, rewards card, gift receipts, donations).Everybody is stressed out because it's next to impossible to get five people in one day to sign up for a credit card, and if they don't then their scheduled hours will go down for next week. Unrealistic expectations! I also notice that store management gets horribly chewed out by corporate for not making metrics and that affects how they treat their crew.Employee discounts could be much better; how about 20% instead of 10% off? We work hard enough for it IMHO.</advice-to-management>

“Professionalism is optional”

</title><pros>Pros – I'm pretty much blinded by the blatant inconsideration and unprofesionalism of upper management. So at this point I have very little to say, but I'll try.... some of the other employees are nice and they do offer a decent benefits package (of which I, personally, have no need for).</pros>
<cons>Cons – There is no follow through or folow up on anything.35 hours a week-  that's a joke. I work minimum of 40 hours and am told that I need to work on my days off (note the "told" and not "asked") then am made to feel badly when I go over 40 hours. I haven't been able to leave on time since I started.  (about 2 months ago)I was told each day would be the same.  Yeah right... I haven't had any consistancy to my responsibilities or tasks.My boss has been nice enough to point out that I'm not needed- the store would be just fine if I didn't work there at all.  Wow, way to boost morale! He also likes to call my direct reports on his day off to have them give me my daily tasks and also share how he feels about me personally.I've walked in the breakroom while he's gossiping about me to employees that report to me.To make things really fun, a long-term p/t employee was just written up because upper management doesn't want her there anymore.</cons>

“Good place to go if you need some extra cash around Christmas, but that's it.”

</title><pros>Pros – Well, the hours are excellent during the Christmas season.  Some complain about the long days and frequent calls of "Can you come in?" but as a poor college student, the extra income was nice.The other coworkers who are seasonal are usually pretty fun to work with.The pay is not good, but it's not bad.  It's minimum wage, but honestly what else can you expect starting out in a place like this?SOMETIMES you get really nice customers who are easy to talk to you and thank you genuinely for your help.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Employees who are not seasonal - who are full-time or regular - generally treat you like dirt.  The managers don't really treat you like anything, since they are always holed up in their locked offices.The amount of training given to new seasonal employees is basically non-existent.  I had to teach myself how to use the cash registers, which really belong in an antique store.  One day during my shift I came in and found that I was scheduled to work the floor, I had no idea what I was supposed to do.  I asked the manager and she told me to basically walk around the store.  ??You will probably have to come in at an ungodly hour on Black Friday.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Train your employees.  Even if they're seasonal and only gonna be there for a couple of months, those are the busiest months of your year and you certainly don't want to tick off customers who may just decide to show up in June and give you some business.</advice-to-management>

“Lots of sales pressure for only a $8.50 job.”

</title><pros>Pros – I like working around mothers to be and babies, and they really help train you to learn the products that they sell.  Many of the people who work her are a more mature crowd other retail jobs. Management lets you know what is expected of you, and it is nice to have concrete goals.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lots of pressure from management to sell buyer protection plans, batteries, and to sign people up for thier loyalty card. While I like having defined goals, I feel like management doesn't appreciate a genuine effort when people aren't interested in buying the items that you are supposed to push. It really is a high-pressure sales job environment, for just above minimum wage. Also, they have many advertised promotions that actually aren't honored half the time, so I feel really bad for the customers that drove a long distance for a deal that was misleading or doesn't exist. The cash registers are from the 70's, or 80's, and require a manager overide for nearly everything. I find myself paging a manager every five minutes, then the poor customer has to wait.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Update your registers to the current century, and have your prices match the fliers.</advice-to-management>

</title><pros>Pros – I liked most of the people who worked there. It was fun being able to see all the new toys and dealing with most customers. I liked the relaxed work environment, meaning the job was easy as pie.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The discount sucks (10%??), management seemed to play favorites, they like to call you in instead of scheduling you, rude customers think you're the CEO, some of my co-workers were annoying, you have to solicit every customer for a rewards card, batteries, and the credit card which gets reallllly old.</cons>

“Being a Toys R Us Kid isn't what it's cracked up to be.”

</title><pros>Pros – The employees are great, and I get along with all of them pretty well, we're close-knit, almost like a family. Half  of the Management team are competent and great to work with. When it's not in Season (Christmas), the job is ridiculously easy and practically stress free.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The Upper Management are, by and large, incompetent and demeaning towards a lot of the employees, and favorites are definitely played. Certain members of management will act very different when the store director isn't there. Pay is simply lousy, and raises are given annually, but amount to pennies and are laughable at best. The HUGE 10% discount is silly, and has so many restrictions that it might as well not exist. And everything  is based on Metrics. (Batteries, BPP's, IC's...etc ad nauseum.) If you can't sell people extended warranties or batteries or high interest credit cards, you're abused verbally and harassed to no end. Be prepared to harass customers to the point of feeling awful about yourself. Meanwhile, while you're pretty much running the store, the management is nowhere to be found, hiding in the office, or taking hour long lunch breaks after being there for 2 hours at most. It's baffling how certain members have been with the company for so long. Certain supervisors have no issue with screaming at you in front of customers, which does nothing for morale, which is a four letter word in the house of Geoffrey. Christmas is absolutely brutal, and surrounded by great dread. The company has since become so disgustingly money-hungry that it has silly hours during the holiday months, seeing nothing wrong with depriving employees of seeing their families. Customers demand the world, and verbally abuse when it's not given to them. Open Thanksgiving? Check. 8PM closing on Christmas Eve? Check. Seasonal employees are given little or no screening, and therefore not qualified to work in a toy store, let alone function as human beings, which makes running the store quite the task. Summer hours are few and far between, maxing out at about 12 hours if you're part time, which you will be, as they NEVER hire for full time. Not recommended. At all.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Take a look at what you're expecting of your employees. Realize the scale of it all, and show a little respect towards them. When all is said and done, they run the store, not you. And if you'd come out of your little office, you'd realize that.</advice-to-management>

“Toys R Us, kids only.”

</title><pros>Pros – Working in a toy store is alot of fun.The EMPLOYEES working there have always been a great team.The salary is more or less the average, about 1 dollar higher than minimum wage.Yearly raise for 90% of the people.Decent schedule, they work around your school or other job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – You are treated as a number, nothing else.Managers / Direction mostly comment on the bad things, not the good ones.You have to do things that would be a bad idea, because the head office (which never worked in a store) wants it that way.Managers/Direction can be very immature, and they are not afraid to yell to employees in front of clients.They think they can threaten teenagers because it's their first job and they don't want to lose it.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I've seen mangers/direction taking gifts that were meant for employees.I've seen immature yelling and put downs of employees in front of clients.Respect company reps, they are there to help the store.

“At your own risk.”

</title><pros>Pros – Trained in one store and worked at another.  Training store was fabulous, reflective of the store manager.  Customers were best part of job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The store manager was completely ineffective.  Other assistants did what they wanted with no communication to others; very little cooperation between assistants.  Employees ruled the store due to H.R. manager's obsession with "be nice".  This store took it to the extreme.  I actually had an employee yell at me on the sales floor and nothing happened to her after I reported it.  Other assistants that I trained with said that they experienced the same behaviour from employees in their stores.  Favorites got away with everything and managers didn't know how to discipline employees; other good employees left because they were overlooked.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – After having off-location meetings, actually follow-up with management to see where they are in implementing new programs.  I was always excited to go to these meetings and hear about new programs but at store level, no response from management or other managers.  Very dispiriting.  While employee relations are extremely important, please investigate thoroughly complaints made by employees.  Establish a manager hotline to report serious infractions that take issues out of store manager's hands; should be mandatory to contact both hotline and store manager immediately.</advice-to-management>

“I wouldn't waste my time if I were you . . .”

</title><pros>Pros – I think about the only thing left would be the earned time off that you can (supposedely) use whenever you want. (Of course you have to convince management that it is in THEIR interest to do so.) And, at least in my case, I am blessed with dear friends, most of the full time staff are really wonderful at my location.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Where to begin? First off, we're lucky to get our schedule for the next week posted on Friday, which makes it close to impossible to have a life of any kind. If you have something come up that messes with their precious schedule once posted, you'd think the world was coming to an end to change it, even though posting it two weeks in advance would eliminate about 95% of their scheduling problems. They have a computer program do their schedule, and they can only do so many edits because if they do too many, oh my god, their "effectiveness" rating might go down and they might get a phone call telling them what a bad boy they are. They make the full time staff work most all the crap schedules, while the part time people (these people "supposedly" hired to work weekends and nights) request all of them off. Every holiday is me and most of the full time people working . . .Management takes the holidays off and manage to get their weekend off a month, while the two key holders in our building have to work every weekend, get no help scheduled with them when they are scheduled to close during the week, and do all the management stuff, and cover a department on the floor, and are expected to have it all completed.It's like pulling teeth trying to get a little bit of recognition for the hard work you do. A simply "thank you" or a pat on the back is pretty much nonexistent here. It doesn't pay to go out of your way here, so the majority of us don't anymore. Why bother?Our raises were cut to the bone this year, most of us getting less than half of what we might have otherwise, because of the recession, but the company managed to find the millions of dollars to buy 4 different internet companies in lieu of all of that.They are now integrating Babies R Us and Toys R Us, and it is a micro-management hell now with a bunch of useless clipboards and even more useless "routines" that will pretty much run BRU into the ground before too long. It's pretty obvious that the company doesn't care about it's employees anymore, all they are worried about is the bottom line.Their medical insurance is the biggest joke of all. It's expensive as can be, doesn't cover CRAP, and their prescription drug coverage is the most horrible I've ever heard of.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Wake up to the fact that you are running this company into the ground quick. So much has changed in the last six months, and most of it for the worse, that it's not going to be too long before you're going to see you've screwed yourself and ruined your brand. You've got stores full of robots now, shuffling a bunch of useless papers around, passing around clipboards with a bunch of information on them that nobody cares about, and aren't going to, ever! It's meaningless drivel that does nothing to push forward your precious guest service, or drive sales. It's micro-management run amok and in the end you're going to have a serious mess on your hands.</advice-to-management>

“Good place for temporary part-time job”

</title><pros>Pros – It is a good place to work as a part-time job. Stocking shelves and cashier is what I do for the most part and it is enough for me as a high school student. Management is okay, I only know my store manager and other employees in my store but I only work part-time and I'm not really involved in other things with the company as a whole. Again, good place to work and gain responsibility. It is pretty easy going and flexible with hours, the training is good and I get plenty of work and responsibility in my job.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I don't really like the old stores, mine hasn't been updated like some of the others, so it is in a not so good area with bad lighting in the parking lot and it doesn't have the best reputation. It isnt exactly the coolest place to work but again for part-time it is okay. My manager isn't qualified and shouldn't be running the store but I listen to him anyway. A lot of other students that work here aren't motivated and they slack off and still get paid for gossiping with friends over the counter. Pay isn't too great either.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Again, I don't really know too much about senior management because I only work in the one store, but i would say to keep updating stores because no one in the communities like the old ones they are in bad areas and aren't always safe. I think stupid employees who don't take the job seriously should be fired and those of us who do a good job should be paid more or given little bonuses. Also the employee discount is low, I could get 10% off on a coupon if I wanted to, so that would help also along with more hour flexibility.</advice-to-management>

“If you like monotony, here's the place for you.”

</title><pros>Pros – Well, I guess if you still like playing with toys then it could be a great place to work. Other than that, it'sjust a paycheck. Though fellow employees do make it a fun place to work.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It can quite boring. Unless you're given a project by a supervisor you're pretty much stuck just putting away all the reshops (whole carts of toys just waiting to be put back when customers don't want them). Either that or just wandering the aisles straightening and picking up toys off the floor left by some dumbasses who abuse the price checker like it's some kind of new and amazing technology they've never seen before and leave a pile of toys waist-high on the floor. Then, after you've spent 10-12 minutes clearing out the area, putting everything back and straightening the aisle customers managed to completely rearrange by sticking all manner of things in every nook and cranny, you go back 5 minutes later to see it was all for nothing as a whole new group of 'em are lining up by the same price checker and leaving whatever they don't want right there on the floor. They'll even look at you as they're doing it too, almost like they're trying to challenge you to say something so they can go off on you. Idiots...What's worse is when you have a psycho supervisor (who feels the only way to get people to do something is by yelling at them) coming up from behind wondering why you're not doing your job and picking up the crap that's on the floor, not knowing I had just spent 12 minutes of my life doing exactly that. After you're done explaining yourself, and having them still thinking you were slacking off, you take your lunch and come back and do it all over again until the end of your shift. Yay!</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Umm...stop sitting in your office all day and actually come out once in-a-while to give direction to your employees. Sure there's not always a lot for us to do some days, but have us really do things that are useful.</advice-to-management>

“boring”

</title><pros>Pros – As a part time job while at university or school this job is fine. BEcause the stores have a large number of employees they have the capacity to replace shifts if you need to take time off for exams etc. Another benefit for workers who are relativly inexperienced, is the absence of food, its is rare to find a workplace for younger people thays isnt fast food, everything is clean ,and you dont finish shifts smelling of burgers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Ones role in the store is unknown. Many shifts i have been instructed to ¨walk around and make sure everytthing is OK¨ for five hours. No real training into how the store works or details on the stock are given. training consists of a video on OH&S and store policies. consequently, any question from a custoemr that goes beyond ¨where is ...¨ needs to be transfered to a manager.Very rude, bitter and bad tempered customers, or people who expect vauge decriptions of ¨a toy¨ to be in store.</cons>

“Be careful!  A lot promised, little delivered”

</title><pros>Pros – Static sales- not the peaks and valleys of normal retailers who run ads.  The company has tried to make significant changes in the layout of their stores, but this has done little to increase sales.  Margins were high, but this is being eroded away as Babies tries to compete with the Targets and others of this speciality category.  Products offered are kept up to date, but warehouse can not supply stores in a consistent manner.  Training and onboarding of new employees is not well thought out- they try, but it is confusing and not well executed.  Typically a 45-50 hour week.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Micro-managed/very little room for thought or creativity.  Very high turnover with associates throughout chain.  No advancement possible for assistant managers as there are few locations so morale is low and turnover high for assistants.  Panic has set in at corporate as their competitors gradually take market share so there is a lot of initiatives that are not well planned out and too many coming down the pipeline at once.  There is an unhealthy focus on keeping everyone in the stores happy which makes it extremely difficult to manage for fear of "upsetting" an associate, manager, supervisor, etc.  R us organization is just getting by</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Too much change too fast.  Someone needs to oversee change as it is being sensed as panic rather than well thought out decisions.  Too many initiatives at once.  You need to choose what is important and what will drive the business and concentrate on that.  Technology is horrible, especially in terms of supplying stores.  New systems and an up-to-date tech staff is needed.  How the stores can go bare because  there are gliches in programs in this economy is simply unacceptable.  The folks that started Babies 10 years ago were good- time for new ideas and thoughts now from the corporate level right down to the district manager level.</advice-to-management>

It is a place where you can get great satisfaction from making someone happy and seeing the smile on their face. The atmosphere in the store can make you feel young and energized everyday.</pros>
<cons>Cons – constant stress and pressure, unreasonable demands, not enough payroll, too much red tape when trying to get anything accomplished, senior management do not seem to care what is really happening in the field, way too much politics involved in how senior and district management run the business and manage people.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Senior management needs to be more consistent. TRU is struggling with a constant identity crisis.
