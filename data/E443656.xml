“OK place if you know the right people”

</title><pros>Pros – great staff, pleasant guests for the most part.  If you're into working out, discounted membership (NOT FREE)</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you have an idea, it won't go far.....however the same idea by management becomes a priority.  No room for advancement unless you know the right people.  I've seen people with no business in their current position get 'promotions' to other departments because of who they know.  Seen loyal employees 'laid off' to make room for "friends'</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – listen to your staff, NOT THE MANAGEMENT at the CYC.  promote from within, and give more opportunity for growth</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
