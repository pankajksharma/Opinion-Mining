“My job as a Legal Assistant”

</title><pros>Pros – It was my dream job working in an office at a job I had become very familiar with.  I started the filing system based on former experience with another attorney.  I felt welcome and at ease with everyone there.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The only con was that I had to give up the job because of ill health at the time and my wife's illness as well.  I had to remain home and care for her.  Otherwise my time at the office of Robert W. Riply and Associates was great and he was a great employer to work for.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – As an employer I can only say that they should keep up the good work for their clients and employees.  My time at this job ended in 2004 and not 2008.</advice-to-management>
