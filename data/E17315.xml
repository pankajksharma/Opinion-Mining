“Now Closed”

</title><pros>Pros – A great, family-style complement to "big grey"--small shop with big heart. Good leadership from the top, and definitely cared about the employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Didn't get full exposure to big agency, and the senior leadership lacked vision for the company. No focus--youth? entertainment? lifestyle? Identity crisis definitely lead to its downfall.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The agency should have had a clearer point of view, though understand that the changing landscape made it difficult for segment shops (i.e. youth) to compete when so much was going into non-traditional.</advice-to-management>
