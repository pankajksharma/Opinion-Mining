“'Great company overall has its eyes on the future'”

</title><pros>Pros – The company has high ethical standards and a family-oriented culture. There's a healthy emphasis on work-life balance that goes along with it. The projects tend to be of a diverse and interesting flavor. I feel challenged, and at the same time there's a huge net of mentoring, references and help to support me.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The past year was pretty turbulent with the company merging together from numerous entities, but it's all just starting to come together. There's still a lot of disparity between offices with regard to technical tools and standards, but that's to be expected given all of the different backgrounds.The worst, by far, is that I won't be working there forever, given the current market conditions.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Excellent job so far. Best of luck and best wishes!</advice-to-management>
