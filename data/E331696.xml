“Nice family owned company to work for.”

</title><pros>Pros – they treat us good, lots of extra perks.</pros>
<cons>Cons – terrible benefits for office staff and people aren't treated fairly. The owners treat people they like better and give them more leeway and better money and perks. Sucks the life right out of everyone else. Why keep trying harder cause you wo't be recognized as much s the people who are the owners "buddies" or pets.</cons>
