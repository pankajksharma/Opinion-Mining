“Engineer”

</title><pros>Pros – Family atmosphere with great engineers at the lower levels. Work schedule is flexible.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The upper management is corrupt with office politics which results in promotions and/or raises and opportunities are pre-determined before anyone knows your abilities. If you're on the right side of that equation you'll like your job, if you are not within that pre-determined group you will not like the position and soon be looking for other employment due to lack of growth within the company.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Promote from within and promote based on merit instead of personal relationship.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
