“Update spreadsheets of their CDS sales all day.”

</title><pros>Pros – Its in Texas so you don't pay state tax but this can hardly be a pro of the company. Beneficiaries of wealthy local family. Hire mostly from TCU whose graduates certainly appear subpar to some of the other BIg 12 schools.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Rigid company that uses CDS to leverage up on bets against the debt of other companies...we all saw how sustainable that was.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please start hiring from outside of TCU, it's a terrible school and the output shows it. Also nobody cares about your football team so please stop talking about it in the workplace like its the best thing since sliced bread, you just got beat down by BOISE STATE!!!</advice-to-management>
