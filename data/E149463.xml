<title>

“They are a good company to work for, they care about there employees but they have the small business syndrome.”

</title><pros>Pros – Location is good for my commute. Family Owned, smaller company that care and give back to their employees,  No big company, corporate BS that you have when dealing with big corporations.</pros>
<cons>Cons – They are family owned so its a double endged sword. Not a lot of structure between upper mangagement and lower level emplyees. Compensation is not the highest, partly because of location but also because its a small, family owned business. Perks aren't the greatest as well, health, time off - vacation and personal.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stay open to new ideas and keep trying to expand. But keep in mind that expanding will cost money and there is no way around that.</advice-to-management>
