<employee-type>Senior Vice President Marketing + Brand (Current Employee)</employee-type>
<title>

“ID+M has been one of the most fulfilling places to work out in my career.  I see why they were acquired!"”

</title><pros>Pros – They let you grow, they cultivate you and let you grow your own projects and take risks on your ideas and vision & back you all the way.  If it leads to a new product, you get a nice bonus. If it leads to a new division or company, you get stock and a bonus.  It is incredibly positive and the President & CEO are generous and very kind.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hard to leave at nights, but the management team really encourages life outside of work.  I respect that, but there are times when I'm glad I have a company laptop and smart phone so that even if I leave, I remote in and feel like I can finish something up even if I have to go do something at home.   It's a double edged sword here in that I want to stay past the end of the day, but i do get it.  You need off-time.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Never sell your dream to someone else; i.e. the company. You never know what they will do to it and if you can do it again. I hope your payday is great and your future is set.  I know it will be sad to see the team split up and go back east.</advice-to-management>
