“Highest turnover in the oil and gas business for a reason.”

</title><pros>Pros – They pay you some money for work...even if it is 25% below the industry standard.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Benefits are terrible. They only cost you around $125 a month for your family for Med/dental/Vis, BUT, you will make up for it the first time you go to a doctor. You have to meet a deductible of $1500-2000 for you PLUS $2000 for your family. The pay is low. The  management is absolutely dreadful. I can get along with anyone, but these people ran off every decent employee they have ever had. President is a 70 plus year old man that is severely set in his ways. If someone says anything about anyone, he takes it as fact and you can never recover. Luckily this hasn't happened to me, but I witnessed several people this happened to. He has promoted a circle of around 4 people that will do anything he says with absolutely no questions asked. I stood up for one of my guys who was innocent of something I knew he didn't screw up and I was immediately turned in to HR for insubordination. My only ding against me in several years. No recognition for hard work. Very VERY little room to advance. Middle management will never leave and new positions are rarely created. Do not come to work here.</cons>
