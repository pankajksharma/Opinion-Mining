“Worse company ever to work fo”

</title><pros>Pros – I can't think of any pros</pros>
<cons>Cons – Worst company ever worked for in my life  I was a professional salaried employee and was micromanaged.  They pick and choose who they like and those individuals are treated different than others.  Benefit cost tripled in 1 year.  Lay off with no severance.  Managers are micromanagers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Talked to the employees that are making your company successful and learn how they are being treated.  Afterall "people" are your best asset.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
