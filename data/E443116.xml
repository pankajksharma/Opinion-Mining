“Demanding work but rewarding.”

</title><pros>Pros – A small company so pretty much whatever your role you are an important part of the team.Flat management structure - you can get to see the boss easily or the CEO if needed.Opportunities to travel to various parts of the world - some you would want to visit and some you might not.If you can justify the need for equipment and supplies they are bought quickly.Good benefits.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Site work is usually very demanding involving long hours in refineries and chemical plants.Jobs can come up suddenly requiring quick mobilization and can occur at major holidays, birthdays, anniversaries etc.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
