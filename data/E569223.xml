“Hard work at e.style LMC GmbH - event agency with focus on sports marketing - lot of ovetime with basic salary”

</title><pros>Pros – There is a lot of overtime when projects are running. You can learn a lot in a short time. The atmospehre is nice, but also busy. Communication is very fast and results have to be presented quickly to the account director or to the client. But this helps you to manage lot of work in a short time.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Overtime are NOT paid also free time is NOT possible.Sometimes a bit chaotic communication, because of different decisions by the management, which consists of serveral people. Fairly low Salary for the need work and in comparision of the revenue.Depending on the work and project overtime can be normal for several weeks.During project time work in the weekends and bank holidays can be normal.General holidays can only be taken when projects allow it.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
