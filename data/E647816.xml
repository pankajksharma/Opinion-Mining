“Loved working here!”

</title><pros>Pros – They were very flexable with my schedule while I was going to school.  Management was great and easy to get along with. I loved getting the employee discount on everything in the store.  I had great co-workers that were always willing to help if I needed them to.</pros>
<cons>Cons – I did not like dealing with some of the rude customers that came into the store, but you will have those types of people at all jobs.  Had to work nights and weekends.</cons>
