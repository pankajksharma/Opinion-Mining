“Good”

</title><pros>Pros – Caring, passionate people working together in a positive environment to promote human rights.  The office is a decent size for the amount of work done there, and the overall layout promotes a sense of camaraderie. Wide range of age among the workers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not much explicit instruction, but this could be a pro if you do not like to be micromanaged.  Would be nice to have more team-based projects.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend</advice-to-management>
