<title>

“Fun at times.”

</title><pros>Pros – We were always able to drive fancy cars.  It was always fun working there in the summer due to the nice weather.  Some of the cars were fast some suvs.  There was a wide arrangement of cars to choose from</pros>
<cons>Cons – It was extremely cold in the winter.  the management team did not care about the car jockeys one bit.  There were rude and inconsiderate.  We were outside all day and they could not even provide us with milk for our coffee.  Dirty cars, some people have no pride.  they take their car to the valet parking lot with dog hair everywhere and just tons of garbage everywhere.</cons>
