“Make sure you wear armor on your back, they WILL stab you.”

</title><pros>Pros – Middle management is wonderful as are most of the employees.  If there is an emergency they do work with you for time away.  Time for doctors are always allowed.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Ownership and Sr mgt are jealous that some people are more competent than they are.  They are not loyal.  They have a hard time seeing within their own employees capabilities.  They will go outside the company, and pay 10-20 times what could have been done internally.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Look at your own employees, find their capabilities, use them effectively.  You have some great people, who are talented and loyal to you.  Be loyal  and appreciative of them, their talents and capabilities.</advice-to-management>
