“Eye Opening”

</title><pros>Pros – Great hands on experience. It is still a small company so there is a lot of interdepartmental contact, even for interns. Within my first three weeks there I had already worked directly with the CEO and Designer.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is a small company and it is lacking some of the time saving resources that large luxury companies have. It is also lacking in structure and clear guidelines but is getting better.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
