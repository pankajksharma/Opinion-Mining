<title>

“Potential to be great, but not if things remain the same.”

</title><pros>Pros – -Great staff who are well educated and passionate for what they do-Office located in the heart of DC-Interesting and challenging projects-Flexibility as a consultant</pros>
<cons>Cons – -Very small firm-Little room for professional growth-Revolving door-Favoritism by higher management</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – -Higher management should refrain from bad mouthing other consulting firms to employees all the time. This is not professional and comes off as arrogant.-Value your employees. They work hard, often working long hours and over the weekend because they care about the good of the company. Show some gratitude. It is sad to see such a revolving door of such great people come and go through the company. If you treat your professionals better, they will likely stay.-Stop with the favoritism - again, this is not professional. It is very obvious in such a small firm.</advice-to-management>
