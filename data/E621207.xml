“Dissatisfied with internship experience at Lena C Agency School of Arts & Fashion”

</title><pros>Pros – The office was clean and mostly organized. It had a location that was central to downtown activity and business. You had to sign after walking inside the building. All of these things helped shape the professional appearance and experience of the company.</pros>
<cons>Cons – In my experience, the management was not clear about renting their office space through Regus. They also were not honest about their intention of hiring me to increase their customer base, by marketing their business to my friends and peers on campus. I ultimately did not work on the projects I wanted to, nor gain the knowledge and skills that I expected to.Other issues:Lack of communication with management while working on projectsHaving to pay for parking</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Management should be clear about their expectations for interns. They also should be honest about the benefits they offer in exchange for employment.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
