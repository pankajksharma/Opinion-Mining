“Abusive management uses brute force to motivate, will never level with you.”

</title><pros>Pros – Company was doing bad during the auto collapse several years ago, but has been on the upswing during past 2-3 years due to new company ownership.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Employee benefits are withheld without cause. People quit because they are forced to travel to a car plant for months at a time, working 12 hour shifts, often in bad areas of foreign countries, under dysfunctional management. Do not expect to join a team of adults working together. There are no adults here.</cons>
