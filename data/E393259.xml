“SLOW UPHILL BATTLE”

</title><pros>Pros – No micromanagement in place, honors all sorts of employee leaves, does not specify determined amount of leave time.  it's pretty open as to when you need it.</pros>
<cons>Cons – needs more organization, improve on management, needs to increase/bring salaries up to par with the market value.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – do employee reviews, increase salary base after 1 yr of employment, better healthcare benefits package, get feedback from other employees and look into complaints rather than sweeping them under the carpet.  Add firewalls to your systems as the employees enjoy spending a lot of their spare time on Facebook.</advice-to-management>
