</title><pros>Pros – you decide your own work style, implement your own ideas.can do everything yourself hands on- if that is what you want.flexible hours.you can gain a lot of experience because you are thrown in the front lines quick.</pros>
<cons>Cons – no training (but you are expected to know everything once you get in or have background knowledge- it is a law office, right?)no team support. Everyone is too busy working on their own case or their own pile of work.get put onto a case that has been worked on/passed on for years, and have a lack of notes.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – needs to have a more teamwork focused environment.(Yes, you have "passed the bar" or "are a lawyer" , or have absolutely NO TIME, but to have a SUCCESSFUL law firm, you might want to lower your chin a bit and help the paralegals out).</advice-to-management>
