“Real R&D”

</title><pros>Pros – This seems to be a company where the Engineering / R&D department really are doing research.  There is a lot of "try this and see if it works."They are very supportive of new hires and realistic that it takes time to learn their technology.These are some of the nicest people I've worked with, across multiple departments.</pros>
<cons>Cons – People are pulled in a lot of different directions at once, so it can be hard to finish a project.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Focus and work to avoid last minute changes and side projects.</advice-to-management>

“Promising technology, questionable management”

</title><pros>Pros – Ability to work on emerging 3D display technology, ability to use great tools, work with talented engineers, compelling software environment.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Both nepotism and cronyism flourish.  It appears to be based on friends of upper management or friends of the VC.  Doesn't seem that Engineers are valued as highly as managers.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Take a more holistic approach to the business.  Consider more carefully the selection of managers in terms of how the Engineering team will be affected.  As an R&D company, the company is only as good as its Engineers.</advice-to-management>
