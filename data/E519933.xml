“Worst company to work with”

</title><pros>Pros – Colleagues were good and friendly.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Dont you ever join this company. This company actually feeds on their employees. I had left this organization in 2010, I was supposed to be getting my last month's salary after 3 months..it is 2013  now and i have still not received it. I strictly suggest all of you to avoid joining this company. The HR is always ready to come up with all new stories related to why they cant pay us the salary. I was not the only one, there are many of them.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You are going into losses, because you don't have a culture to follow.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
