“Great place to work for a therapist”

</title><pros>Pros – The therapists and staff work well together. The owners actively participate in the every day operations of the practice. If something needs to be done, the owners take action. Therapist commissions are 50% of what is received per session. The schedules are flexible and therapists can work as much as they want depending on the salary they desire. Therapists do not have to do their own marketing, but can if they want. There are several company celebrations throughout the year where all employees and family members can attend.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There are times when client intake is low, such as during the summer, so you might not have the client numbers you need or want. Most therapists have a second job.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
