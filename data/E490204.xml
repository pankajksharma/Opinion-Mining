“Very disappointing.”

</title><pros>Pros – I decided to accept a job offer from K-Var Corporation because their Sales Rep / Telemarketing position matches my skills and interests.  The salary was commensurate with the required responsibilities, and they work a very ideal schedule.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The Genreal Manager (who hires the telemarketers), has never made a sales call and therefore has no clue as to how to properly train and advise new-hires.  He is very demanding and unsupportive.  He expects strong results without having to take a hand in the development of his people.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Lead by example.  If you're going to set a high sales-expectation for others, you should first demonstrate how it's achieved yourself.  You provided no leadership and I suspect it's because you don't have the courage to emerge from your sequestered office in the warehouse.  I don't think you could make a success of telemarketing the company's products if your life depended upon it.</advice-to-management>
