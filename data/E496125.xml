<employee-type>Public Servant (Level A) (Former Employee)</employee-type>
<title>

“Good job with strong responsabilities, but not properly paid.”

</title><pros>Pros – Many positions with strong responsabilities with regard to markets regulation, international meetings, subsidies to Research & Development, Visits of State, questions in Parlament, speeches for managers and so no.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Balance of competencies not properly structured and bad organization of duties.Public servants with level A are doing all the main tasks and not because of salary or high skilled porfiles but because of their sense of State and good moral behaviour.Many others public servants with lower levels (B, C, D and E) are not giving good administrative suport due to lack of management and incentives to have a good efficiency.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – To keep levels A with incentives and permanent contracts, as way to assure their independence from politicians and temporal Governments. But, specially, not reduce more times their salaries because they are supoorting the performance of the Spanish administration and they are running out of public jobs.And, of course, to focus actions and changes of status in lower levels (B, C, D and E) in order to introduce incentives but on the basis of non-permanent contracts.</advice-to-management>
