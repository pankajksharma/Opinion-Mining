“Tons of Autonomy”

</title><pros>Pros – Working at C.O.T. Inc. allowed me the opportunity to grow and and advance in my career.   Employees are treated with the utmost respect and the company appreciates and rewards hard work.  As a manager, I had a lot of autonomy and was free to make decisions so long as I met my sales goals.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Mostly a seasonal job. Very busy in the summer not so much in the winter.</cons>
