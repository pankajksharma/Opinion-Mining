<title>

“They take very good care of the caretakers but not so much of their caregivers.”

</title><pros>Pros – I feel that I have had a very good connection with out current caretaker and lucky enough to be able to a bit of my life to work so it doesn't limit how much I can work . Also feel that it is nice to have constant support in how to continue to develop our work with our caretaker. Plus some very good colleges.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Lousy pay and not much understanding that you actually have a life outside work since are constantly buggering you to work the few free days you have.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Do something about and have enough of a good amount of reliable extra people so when sickness and such occur you don't have to work the staff you already have to death. Using people who are already hired at other caretakers and hoping that they will be free to work is not such a good idea.</advice-to-management>
