“Awesome Place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – Awesome bosses, good pay, good experience, very laid back about time off for valid reasons, plenty of water breaks and great co-workers</pros>
<cons>Cons – Hard work in the sun, but it's fair and well-compensated.  Some annoying clients that you will deal with but they're all tolerable</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Don't really have any advice to offer management that they don't already know.  Bosses are pretty smart and experienced in the field.</advice-to-management>
