<employee-type>IT & Volunteer Coordinator (Former Employee)</employee-type>
<title>

“While the mission is admirable, the company lacks structure, proper communication, and suffers constant whims of crisis.”

</title><pros>Pros – There is no better feeling than knowing the difference you are making by helping children and our community. This is also an excellent learning environment to be exposed to a wide variety of jobs and skills as there are many needs to be filled. If the company worked as idealized, it would be a wonderful environment for all involved.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The experience of actually working at the company proved that it lacked a substantial foundation to work within. Presumably due to high levels of stress caused by this, the company suffered constant whims of crisis; there were instances of inadequate and unreasonable communications as well as unrealistic expectations made with improper resources available to meet those demands.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The leadership needs to provide a stable structure, adequate resources, realistic goals, and more appropriate communications for the employees and volunteers to successfully attain this applaudable vision. Either spend more resources on strictly defining job roles, ensuring proper communications, and planning out projects before implementing them to avoid scope creep and other resource issues or allow the open learning environment advertised without the obviously coercive manipulation, condescension and reprehensible attitude toward those who don't meet every idealistic goal.</advice-to-management>
