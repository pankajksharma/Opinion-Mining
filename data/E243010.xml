“Good experience but you work a ton.”

</title><pros>Pros – Friendly and extremely diverse staff. Great life experience. Resume booster. Make a difference in kids. 3 meals a day, airport transportation and housing included.</pros>
<cons>Cons – 85+ hours a week average work for very little pay. Very little privacy or free time while working there. Can be very stressful at times.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – I think that management should be more upfront about what working will actually be like before starting. It is an excellent opportunity but it is good to know what you're getting into.</advice-to-management>
