“Educational work experience, learned a lot.”

</title><pros>Pros – As a student, I was brought in contact with graduate students and scientists whom I would never have met otherwise.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The only downside was the work environment was quite sterile, as a research lab should be. The environment was functional, not fun. It was obviously geared towards performing experiments and not so much on employee morale.</cons>
