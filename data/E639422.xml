“Surreal in it's bizarre structure”

</title><pros>Pros – Advertising is inexpensive.  Graphic designers are helpful.</pros>
<cons>Cons – TURNOVER like you have never seen. Long days of meandering meetings.  Poor structure.  Support staff is encouraged to be rude to reps  and nothing is ever done about it.  Poor pay with promises it will get better but commissions are low.  Poor reputation in marketplace.  The management takes call ins and in some areas then calls on clients.  The management takes all viable accounts of reps who have left and holds them for themselves.  You have "HR" as the owners wife who also is a rep.  They insult certain reps on an ongoing basis who are performing better than the ones they praise. Rules change hourly.  Most of all, a totally demoralized atmosphere where you are treated as a 3rd grader.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop talking poorly about your current and past employees.   Keep rules consistent.  Stop your support staff from insulting your sales staff.   Treat employees as adults and professionals.</advice-to-management>
