<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Please be fair in your judgement, and not assume/accuse your employees are out to get you.Even though this is a small company, I highly suggest management (Owner) to be realistic and  distribute work load as titled. Also, your employees don't really want to hear about your personal life as much as you would like to discuss it.</advice-to-management>
