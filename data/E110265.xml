“Be afraid, be very afraid....”

</title><pros>Pros – To make connections to get out of there! You can make some amazing connections at this place! Decent place to work if you're looking to get your foot in the door in the design field. Not too horrible for hourly employees. Management and other employees are willing to work around personal issues at work....</pros>
<cons>Cons – .... but be careful, because if you make known personal issues (to management or not) so you can get a little help from your employer, it often comes back to bite you. Any knowledge of personal or professional flaws is exploited eventually. Low/Unfair compensation. Horrible management; great if you're on the right person's side, hell if you aren't.  Vicious competition between some employees; affects everyone. Poor communication within the organization. Management wont listen to employees.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to your employees; treat them with a little respect; act with honesty; back up your employees- it's not the team enviornment you preach. It's more dog-eat-dog.  Resolve ethical issues that run rampant with your commision based employees.</advice-to-management>
