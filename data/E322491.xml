“I like my job.”

</title><pros>Pros – I am one of the fortunate employees.  I work for good people.  My job allows me to help the public, which I like.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Our county government is run by some really stupid County Council members.  We have council members who only listen to the protesting vocal minority and then propose and try to pass laws for these people to make themselves look good.  County Council members try to micromanage departments and their budgets without  knowing details of how the department is run.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Rethink the furloughs.  Rethink  freeze in salaries and wages.  County workers are not highly paid.  We have bills to pay and families to support.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
