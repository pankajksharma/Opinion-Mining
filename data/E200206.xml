“Good place to make a living but not much excitement.”

</title><pros>Pros – Good compensaion and friendly atomosphere. Very easy to stay.The major customer is virutually one and you can concentrate to support them although it's a tough customer.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Not many opportunities to expand professional abilities and to have exciting challenges.The owrk starts 8:30 and no flex time for anyone. I think it depends on the job. It would be better to have more flexible work time for particularly those who are technical such as support engineers and sales engineers.When telephone conference is neccessary with Japanese headquarters and partner engineers, we have to stay at evening and many times the conference is very long. So the flex time would be good for this kind of situation too.</cons>
