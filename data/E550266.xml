“It is the worst experience of interview ever till now in my little Professional Life”

</title><pros>Pros – No thing is Positive what I can see from outside with in the company</pros>
<cons>Cons – I was disqualified in the interview by HR on the basis of 2 Questions1) I don't know my past company M.D Sir  Qualification2) As I have been told by HR Recruiter no employee of M.Tech knows any other language apart from MARATHI .The company recruiters questions continuously revolves round the above 2 Questions only for 15 min.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The Top Management of company must know that an HR Person is the face of the company.Also the employees of company should be given soft skill training after regular intervalsThe company if targeting for bigger profits should teach their employees other languages also apart from MARATHI (which is the only known language by the company employees as per the HR recruiter of the company)I don;t have any personal rivalry with the company, I am just sharing my bitter interview experience with you all. U also can confirm it with the company HR itself</advice-to-management>
