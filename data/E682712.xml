“Very Deceptive Business Practices”

</title><pros>Pros – Shifts do not begin until noon, a pro if you're a night owl.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Door-to-door sales alone, no safety measures are provided, own personal car must be used and mileage is not reimbursed, 100% commission-based salary, long work days, psychological manipulation methods are used to keep employees from demanding better work environment (employees will be called out every time they say something negative, etc.)</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Be completely transparent of what the job actually entails in both the job description and the interview. Warn candidates of the dangers that come along with door to door sales. Provide safety precautions. Create a more professional environment. Do not let team leaders carpool applicants against their will.</advice-to-management>
