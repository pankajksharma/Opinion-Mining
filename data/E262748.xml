“they want draftsman, limited learning experience”

</title><pros>Pros – The firm has some interesting restoration projects of various scales. They have a good preservation philosophy.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you're fresh out of school, nobody will ever tell you about these projects, nothing about scope, schedule, budget, client, anything. All you do is draft. No growth potential, and pay is pretty low. Office communication is almost zero.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Project details should NOT be kept secrets from juniors.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
