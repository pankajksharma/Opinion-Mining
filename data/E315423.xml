“Great things at RPJ Housing”

</title><pros>Pros – The new CEO is great. Just a super nice guy, very considerate and respectful. Good at giving people guidance, offering assistance when needed, and otherwise staying out of the way. Really nice coworkers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Fallout from the last CEO and the issues surrounding him. Pay needs to increase and I am looking forward to better processes and procedures.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It's so refreshing to have a board and CEO that care about the organization and the people who work here. I really hope the new CEO will choose to stay but I don't blame him if he wants to go somewhere else. Even just in a few weeks he's done a great job of cleaning up the place and restoring trust and integrity.</advice-to-management>
