“horrible place to work”

</title><pros>Pros – work is not stressful for a content writer.</pros>
<cons>Cons – not  a great place to work for anyone with some self respect. Management is horrible. People watching your every move from chennai head office through cctv. so many employees quit work within the 1st month i joined there. the BDE's and telecallers disturb a lot as they are very noisy.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
