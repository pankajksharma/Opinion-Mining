“The relationship between co-workers is great as is the company atmosphere.”

</title><pros>Pros – The people make it worth working at Mercury Z. If you want to work somewhere that the company culture is completely influenced by the work people are doing every single day and how those people relate to each other, then working at Mercury z isn't so bad.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you want to grow in your career or move forward, you may not be able to. You may find that you have been stuck in a rut because it's where they see you as best. It may not be where your talents truly are. Management works on a need to know basis and most times they don't think you need to know, even when they are planning a big change.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – The more open you are with your staff, the better they will feel about coming to work. They have been there a long time and have a certain amount of loyalty. They are just hoping that eventually you start showing little loyalty in return. Having once a month cake for birthdays or the occasional pizza day does nothing for anyone. It's a joke and not a team building or good feeling thing, it's awkward, especially within days of doing a lay off of almost everyone.</advice-to-management>
