<title>

“This is a reasonably good job provider.”

</title><pros>Pros – Working hours are very good, salary is regular and adequate. In the last few years there has been a substantial improvement in the organisation inside the company which makes everyday work easier. There are some opportunities to travel.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Small chance of promotion. In general you can expect to work on the same job for years. There are some opportunities to change departments inside the company but these are fairly rare.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
