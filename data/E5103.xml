“Company culture reflects nepotism and religious zealotry.”

</title><pros>Pros – If you are related to someone that already works there or share in their religious views...you can wear whatever title you like, and draw a good salary for non-performance.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The home office is a self-contained environment where your every move is strictly controlled and monitored.  Do not think about eating off-site or even filling up your car with gas nearby in the City of Dearborn.  That will be considered treason.</cons>
<advice-to-management>No, I would not recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
