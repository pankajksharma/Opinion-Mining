“Great company to work with...”

</title><pros>Pros – Family owned business.  Owner and board of directors truly, honestly care about thier people.  Have been known to throw out christmas bonuses to EVERYONE.  Have been known to offer benifits to thier full time laborers.  Relatively flexible about time off.  Thier employees are some of the most compitent in the construction industry.  There really is nothing bad you can say about them.  Highly reccomended company to work for.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Occassional double days (day shift followed 8 hours later by a graveyard shift).  Still, as well as you are treated by management, you don't mind doing it for them.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – None.  Don Anderson and his staff are spot on.  You really can't ask much more than what these guys do.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
