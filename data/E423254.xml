<title>

“It was a fun and challenging job, but I was underpaid and never got promised raises or promotions.”

</title><pros>Pros – The job is fun and interesting, with challenges that keep you on your toes. It's rewarding to see your orders completed and meet satisfied customers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There seemed to be some strange politics at the top level of management, and those in the middle levels of management like myself rarely got promised or implied raises or promotions. We worked full time, be because it was seasonal, we did not get benefits. The hours were grueling, so even though there was plenty of overtime, we did not get adequate time off and sometimes not even enough sleep.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Get people who work 40hrs plus benefits, give at least one day off a week regularly to employees, and don't imply or make promises that won't be kept. Figure out a system that works for management, and keep it going.</advice-to-management>
