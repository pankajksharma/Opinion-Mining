“Worst workplace ever experienced”

</title><pros>Pros – There are absolutely no pros to working at this practice</pros>
<cons>Cons – Terrible treatment of employees.  Low pay, no insurance, constantly having work thrown at you, no job description, constant verbal abuse, a 30 minute lunch break......for employees while this husband and wife operation take many breaks to nap, snack or play crossword puzzles.  Their only concern is incoming money from patients and insurance companies.</cons>
