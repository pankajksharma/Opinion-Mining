“IF YOU LIKE EASY AND LAZY THIS IS FOR YOU”

</title><pros>Pros – It's a very laid back company and you always have extra time on your hands.  This company offers a variety of benefits.  The benefits range from dental and health insurance to 401k plans and paid vacations.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Management really sucks because they don't communicate with you. There is no overtime for much of the office.  Some people take advantage of the situation.  There is little room for improvement as management does not want to see you succeed.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – You need to start working more hours and stop being so stuck up.  Communicate with your fellow coworkers and tell them what you are doing when you take 3 hours for lunch.</advice-to-management>
