“A Job- Nothing More, Nothing Less”

</title><pros>Pros – Depending on management, flexible hours may be a possibility.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The company is completely disorganized. They contract all their work to vendors across the globe, so in all actuality they do not have the power to get the job done. All departments are overworked and there is NO recognition of anything. The company does not make it comfortable to get your work done. The micro-management is atrocious, it takes three people to get one thing done.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Re-vamp your entire company layout. Just gut the whole thing because this company sucks.</advice-to-management>
