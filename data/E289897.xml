“What is really happening behind the curtain”

</title><pros>Pros – They still have a pulse, but it's fading fast.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Horrible leadership and sales.  Company is going to die on the vine.  Old CEO forced out, junior partner took over and doesn't understand the business.  In 2 years company went from 150 to 50 consultants billing.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Fire Sandeep and hire someone who understands the business and can drive business and revenues.  Anil Kappa was removed from his post in 2010, he isn't perfect, but head and shoulders above the current leader!</advice-to-management>
