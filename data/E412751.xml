“Big Micromanager works here”

</title><pros>Pros – Not too hard to get time off of work...unpaid.Flexible schedule</pros>
<cons>Cons – One business owner who does a LOT of micromanaging.Walks around and sips his tea cup and looks at everyone's screens.Refuses to deal with unhappy customers who ask for a supervisor.Has employees blatantly lie about business practices.Office is dead silent and does not allow you to listen to music.If you ask a question, he'll give you a dirty look or tell you why you already should know this.You'll find yourself explaining things to him a dozen times.No benefits.No room for advancement.Job is fine if you are looking for something in between, but not permanent.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Stop the micromanaging and work WITH your employees not against.</advice-to-management>
