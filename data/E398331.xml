“I love working at I love sushi”

</title><pros>Pros – It is the best waiting job I've ever had. The management is fair to everyone and has their systems set up correctly. They are smart and generous and understanding people. Working there is like working with a family. Money is very good too. 60-200 on weekdays and 200+  on weekends.</pros>
<cons>Cons – No benefits, it's a serving job.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – No advice they do an amazing job!</advice-to-management>
