“A Learning Experience in an English-language Media Co. in Taiwan”

</title><pros>Pros – I worked as an editor and the close interaction with different departments enabled me to learn other aspects of the media industry. Among other things, I learned how advertising rates are decided, how PowerPoint presentations are made to bid for government contracts, and how the big news agencies (Reuters, AP, NYTimes) sell their content to smaller companies such as Taiwan News.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Chaotic management system and lack of objective management standards. Everyone is just working for a salary without any desire to set higher standards of professionalism.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Find time to better understand the latest trends in the media industry, dare to disagree with the owner, and establish a more professional system of rewarding employees based on meritocracy.</advice-to-management>
