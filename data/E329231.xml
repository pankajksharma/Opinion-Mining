“High School Clique”

</title><pros>Pros – The job is a great opportunity for someone who has limited experience in the working world and is especially social.  That being said, this place is more of a starter place than a long term commitment.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Those who work there longer, even by just a few months, act like they own the place.  There are meetings every week that lay out rules, which only seem to be followed by the new people and feedback pertaining to how you are performing is rarely given.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – There needs to be better communication between the managers and the employees.  A new employee just learning the ropes may need a little more guidance and also needs to have the opportunity to discuss any issues arising within the department.  Also, while it is good to have a happy job environment, it may be good to make sure that older employees are working and not just hanging out.</advice-to-management>
