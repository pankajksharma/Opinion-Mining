“Several years and still happy!”

</title><pros>Pros – Great people.  Fun, challenging and collaborative environment.  Management genuinely cares about the staff, and they offer flexible work schedules where you can work 9 hours Monday through Thursday and 4 hours on Friday!  Some people even work from home on Friday's, depending on their job duties and commute.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Kaiser health plan can be a CON for some.  The management is a bit of a boy's club and is often not transparent enough.  They're also reluctant to hire "unbillable" support - resulting in a shortage of administrative manpower.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Hire some paper pushers and share "the plan!"</advice-to-management>
