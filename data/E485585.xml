“Totally impractical expectations”

</title><pros>Pros – - Good & dedicated staff- Advance Salary System</pros>
<cons>Cons – - Passion & Dedication is evaluated considering the amount of overtime- Planning & scheduling is done with default assumption that people will 'manage' through overtime- Company is solely driven by financial figures. No insistence on technical progress.- Lack of patience in top level management- Increased attention to Quick-fix solutions and lack of vision for long term or permanent solutions.- Big communication gaps not just vertically but even among members of top-level staff- Impractical expectations- Lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities- Lack of training for new staff- Packed office space</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – - Desperate need to come out of 'start-up' mindset.- Working extra to complete some task is understandable but scheduling with the assumption 'employee will work extra and complete it' is something that is very much harmful to the employee.- There is no relation whatsoever, between employees dedication & passion and the amount of extra working hours or days he/she puts in.- While financial figures are important but technical progress should be stressed as much. 'Previously working on 4 technologies and today on 8' is not technical progress. Facing lesser number of technical challenges (of the same types) is technical progress.- Work-around & Quick-fixes are good as temporary solutions but long term or permanent solutions are not necessarily quick. Quick-fixes & work-around eventually bring the same issues again and again (sometimes in different ways) and keep adding more future delays.- Patience is needed not only to work on long term but time consuming solutions but also in judging the 'output' of employees. 'Output' of the employee at the lowest level could be judged in less time but the higher the post, the greater time it takes in judging the output.- Employees forming the middle level are the best people to invest in long term and time-consuming solutions which ensures proper technical progress.- With time & increase in the number of employees, formalizing the work processes helps in clarity in communication. While steps are taken to formalize things but proper intent and the patience required is not seen.- Some of the expectations are totally impractical and more-so considering no proper training methodologies.- There are huge gaps in communication among members of top-level-management.- Reluctance in starting the implementation of time-consuming solutions only 'wastes' double the time.</advice-to-management>
