“The best place to work in a crazy no personal life job”

</title><pros>Pros – For a tow opperator having a 12 hour shift on and 12 hours off is a great benifit!    The towing equipment is all very well maintained and new and thus makes for a much easier to complete jobs and impress customers.   All workers there are competent and friendly and make each day of work in a high stress job a little more fun.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Once you start as a driver you can pretty much count on the fact that you will always be just a driver.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – To give the good news about the job being done aswell as the bad.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
