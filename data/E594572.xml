“Attorney at Law and Civil Law Notary No. 10”

</title><pros>Pros – Litigation provides a new challenge every day, but the practice of law is an art with little or no science involved. That said, once you get to a hearing, trial or other proceeding, things are relatively formulaic. Not a hard job unless it's a hard case, and even easy cases can become difficult and what you think might be a difficult case can be easier than you first imagine.</pros>
<cons>Cons – The expertise of the judiciary in Alabama varies widely, as does the skill level of lawyers. I routinely had certain judges call me by other lawyers names. Law Practice in Alabama and the movie "My Cousin Vinny" are more similar than different. Knowing what can work and what can't is a function of experience, and no two courts are exactly the same.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Patient persistence is key. Litigation frays everyone's nerves, and a decent lawyer does his best to get the client through the process as quickly as possible. Notwithstanding, there are always unwelcomed surprises that can and do change your approach. If you can't roll with constant change, the private practice of law will see you dead and buried.</advice-to-management>
