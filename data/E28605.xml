“Micro-Management. All the decision making is in the hands of the executives. Employees are not empowered.”

</title><pros>Pros – Family oriented. Most people working here are related to each other so you can trust your colleagues. It is easy to fit in build personal relationships.</pros>
<cons>Cons – There are rarely any cross level meetings. Employees are not motivated to share ideas, problems, and concerns. Innovation is lacking within the company which results to higher cost to clients. Without implementation of new ideas and ways to work smarter, employees across the board are complacent which sets up a bad environment to work in. Most employees hired "just" need a job. The hiring process is very unprofessional.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – More meetings, empowerment, and feedback from management. Executives should focus on providing employees the necessary resources to work smarter.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>No</recommended>
