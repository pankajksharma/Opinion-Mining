“Ok place if all you want is a paycheck.”

</title><pros>Pros – Supportive if you need time off, but not too much time.  Nice building and free drinks and snacks.  Good location.</pros>
<cons>Cons – If you are out for more than three weeks due to illness, you will be fired.  Watch out if there is a so called temp because that person is there to take someone's job.</cons>
