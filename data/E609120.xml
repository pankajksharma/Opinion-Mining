“Beautiful small office environment, opportunity to wear many hats”

</title><pros>Pros – Being a small office, your experiences are wide-ranging.  Never a dull moment, from working with clients to prospective oil and gas companies to current tenants.  Good working hours and friendly office mates. Mr. Dorsey owns many companies, so there are many opportunities to become involved and grow within the organization.</pros>
<cons>Cons – It is a small office, so you have limited exposure to the "outside world".  For some, that may be considered a negative.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
