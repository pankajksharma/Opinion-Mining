“Fraud consulting company”

</title><pros>Pros – None. There are many person who have already burnt their fingers. So BEWARE of v-edgesoftwarelabs .</pros>
<cons>Cons – Guys never trust v-edgesoftwarelabs people. They will show you big big dreams about placing you in Gulf area. Specially in Saudi Arabia.Do not believe them. Ensure you do not resign your current job on v-edgesoftwarelabs promises otherwise you will regret your decision in your entire life. They will make you wait for 2-3 months without job and will not get the visa for Saudi. Coz you would have resigned from your company and might not have any other options in your hand so you have to wait for that. Even if they arrange the visa that would be Visit visa. Do not loose your permanent job coz of these cheaters. Some of the big cheaters from v-edgesoftwarelabs are Sivabalan, Vishnu. They will make big promises but as soon as you reach in Saudi they take complete U turn. So think 100 times before saying yes to these cheaters</cons>
