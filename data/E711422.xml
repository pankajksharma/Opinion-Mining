“Champion company but work assignment grew tedious and peer supervision sucked”

</title><pros>Pros – Worked on a project that provided early investigation about housing discrimination - worthy work. Likeable president and permanent staff. Good location - 30th and Market Street. Willingness to accommodate pt temp schedules. When work load demanded re-scheduling of work days, the Company paid workers in advance. Not sure many companies would do that for temporary, part-time workers. Told that the company would and had re-hire(d) "good" employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Data entry pool setting with selected peer supervisors not my favorite work arrangement. Clique culture of peer supervisors. Performance called for typing speed AND accuracy. If those are not your strong points, look else.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Peer supervisors favor their buddies. They are "nice" until after their peer review.</advice-to-management>
<recommended>Yes</recommended>
