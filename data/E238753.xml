<cons>Cons – Deceptive and dishonest senior managementFailed to honor contracts during layoffs in 2009, leading to multiple complaints and lawsuits against the firmThe work is very repetitive and dull, little intellectual stimulation or challenge -everything is solved with a GE WorkOut (which is not rocket science)</cons>
