“Great place to work!”

</title><pros>Pros – I've had the privilege of recruiting on their behalf for the last few years. Very much a "family" at work; teamwork, camaraderie leading to many long term employees.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Other than being  based in the southestern part of Scarborough which  may make the commute longer for some, nothing negative to comment on.</cons>

“Good people to work with, but not work for.”

</title><pros>Pros – There is a good level of oppourtunity for advancement.  Most of the staff were enjoyable to deal with and lasting friendships were built.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Poor pay rate, even poorer raises.  Often workers would receive dismal yearly raises that crushed morale at raise time.  Even exemplary workers needed to challenge management to get a decent wage increase at these times.  Entirely manual warehouse, no computer equipment involved in daily activities out side of printed pick slips.  Customer service systems were old and outdated.  Minimal job security, workers often feared for jobs.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – My advice was given at time of departure, top management was receptive of commentary and seemed interested in my opinions.</advice-to-management>
