“Good People Working The Line”

</title><pros>Pros – Good people that care about each other. As business dictates they may not always have company support in being able to show it, but individuals will make the effort to let you know that you are valued.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Industrywide issues such as realtors, lenders, etc that don't understand the title process and occassionally have an entitlement mentality. The title company is always the lowest peg on the totem pole in a real estate transaction.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend – I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company</advice-to-management>
