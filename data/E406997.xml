“Dissatisfied - No long term goal”

</title><pros>Pros – Management is not on top of every worker; The mission of the organization is very respected by the communities; Respect life-work balance</pros>
<cons>Cons – No long term vision and financially insecure; They had massive layoffs after moved to "nice" and "unnecessary huge" office; They are focus on just expansion of their brand name, and not much about the mission itself.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Have long scope of vision where the organization goes in 3 yrs, 5 yrs, and even 10 years. Follow the mission statement and provide services closely to the mission. Do not rely onto single big grants and forget about expansion of the organization too soon. If you guys continue to provide better services, expansion will be followed.</advice-to-management>
