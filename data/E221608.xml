<title>

“Relaxed atmosphere, good place to start out in retail. Clothes were fashionable and cute.”

</title><pros>Pros – To gain retail experience. You also get to work with some interesting, laid-back people. Manager at the time was very accommodating on days off as long as notified well in advance. The best part is you get to where whatever as long as it somewhat represents the store. You are not required to wear everything the store sells. Dress is very casual.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Like most sales associate positions, salary increase and opportunity for advancement is scarce. Daily hours are sometimes long, sometimes environment was too relaxed. Seemed as though company wasn't that organized, but they are a fairly new chain. Sales were slow, it was sometimes hard to make goals. Location in mall was bad but since then the location has moved.</cons>
