“Overall, this is a good employer that does amazing things to improve the quality of life for children.”

</title><pros>Pros – Great benefits, competetive pay, and really great people.  The physicians genuinely care about their patients, but management is so busy playing the numbers game that they often lose sight of the mission.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Some of the Executive Managment/Administrative team have their favorites, and those are the people who do well.  Unless you are well liked by those specific people, you may have a difficult time getting opportunities for advancement or recognition for work done.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – Listen to the staff - often they are providing true insight to what you may or may not see every day.  Everyone brings value of some sort; it is management's job to figure out where they will flourish the most; sometimes the right people just aren't sitting in the right seat - but that doesn't mean that they aren't valuable nonetheless.</advice-to-management>
