“My experience here at Rise n' Shine has been fantastic because we are able to make a difference and help children.”

</title><pros>Pros – We are a non profit where the money and support REALLY goes to the kids! That's what it is ALL about.  We help children affected by HIV/AIDS through support groups, matching them with mentors, running a week long summer camp that is free for every kid and we make sure every kid gets holiday needs met. Pretty amazing! All with a fleet of energetic and caring volunteers.</pros>
<cons>Cons – We are small and growing. I wish we were bigger so we could help more children. We are building up our board of directors and our Advisory Council. We always need more volunteers to help mentor the kids. We always are looking for new fundraising opportunities although we have some amazing events throughout the year.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – We need to be open minded about change coming our way as we grow which is hard for everyone to understand, whether on staff, a volunteer or a donor supporting Rise n' Shine.</advice-to-management>
