“Good Experience”

</title><pros>Pros – The pay is good and yearly bonuses are provided along with annual raises in order to encourage retention. They offer better than industry-standard health-benefits. They will pay for half of your gym membership and have a "dress for success" program that reimburses you for clothes. The company provides valuable services and has a proven track-record. Despite the economy, it's actually turning down business as it's focused on stable growth and delivering quality work. On your first day, they send you a fruit-basket.</pros>
<cons>Cons – Be ready to play some politics. The culture, on the outside, seems friendly. However, there is little support and constructive feedback. There WAS constant criticism given under the pretense that it was for "my own good" and because "I could take it." The individual responsible for training me had no prior management experience and gave me attitude more often than not every time I asked for his assistance. Furthermore, when I did something "wrong" he would confront me about it through E-mail, even when I sat right next to him. You are told that it is an open environment and that there is a lot of flexibility. However, all of your vacation days will be second-guessed, as well as any important appointments, even if you are caught up on your work. There are also no clear goals or metrics to judge performance; it is up to whether or not the principals like you. They say that there is low-turnover, but for a company with less than 30 people, losing more than 3 people a year is significant.</cons>
<advice-to-management>Advice to Senior Management – It's extremely difficult to run a business, so take this for what it is worth. Maintain the perks and fringe-benefits that make it great working at X by 2. Set clear expectations for new hires and be willing to listen to their feedback to understand where they are coming from and why they are unhappy; don't just shut them out because they haven't been with the company long enough or because you question their "DNA." Stop with the Passive Aggressive management styles and confront employees by face rather than through E-mail.</advice-to-management>
